<h2><span class="h2line1">BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</span></h2>
<p class="center"><span class="ss"><span class="large">Communicated by
<br>Paul Austin Delagardie</span></span></p>
<p>I am asked by Miss Sayers to fill up certain lacunae and correct
a few trifling errors of fact in her account of my nephew Peter&rsquo;s
career. I shall do so with pleasure. To appear publicly in print
is every man&rsquo;s ambition, and by acting as a kind of running
footman to my nephew&rsquo;s triumph I shall only be showing a
modesty suitable to my advanced age.</p>
<p>The Wimsey family is an ancient one&mdash;too ancient, if
you ask me. The only sensible thing Peter&rsquo;s father ever did was
to ally his exhausted stock with the vigorous French-English
strain of the Delagardies. Even so, my nephew Gerald (the
present Duke of Denver) is nothing but a beef-witted English
squire, and my niece Mary was flighty and foolish enough till
she married a policeman and settled down. Peter, I am glad
to say, takes after his mother and me. True, he is all nerves
and nose&mdash;but that is better than being all brawn and no brains
like his father and brother, or a bundle of emotions like Gerald&rsquo;s
boy, Saint-George. He has at least inherited the Delagardie
brains, by way of safeguard to the unfortunate Wimsey temperament.</p>
<p>Peter was born in 1890. His mother was being very much
worried at the time by her husband&rsquo;s behaviour (Denver was
always tiresome, though the big scandal did not break out till
the Jubilee year), and her anxieties may have affected the boy.
He was a colorless shrimp of a child, very restless and mischievous,
and always much too sharp for his age. He had
nothing of Gerald&rsquo;s robust beauty, but he developed what I can
best call a kind of bodily cleverness, more skill than strength.
He had a quick eye for a ball and beautiful hands for a horse.
He had the devil&rsquo;s own pluck, too: the intelligent sort of pluck
that sees the risk before it takes it. He suffered badly from
nightmares as a child. To his father&rsquo;s consternation he grew up
with a passion for books and music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vii">vii</div>
<p>His early school-days were not happy. He was a fastidious
child, and I suppose it was natural that his school-fellows should
call him &ldquo;Flimsy&rdquo; and treat him as a kind of comic turn. And
he might, in sheer self-protection, have accepted the position
and degenerated into a mere licensed buffoon, if some games-master
at Eton had not discovered that he was a brilliant natural
cricketer. After that, of course, all his eccentricities were accepted
as wit, and Gerald underwent the salutary shock of
seeing his despised younger brother become a bigger personality
than himself. By the time he reached the Sixth Form, Peter
had contrived to become the fashion&mdash;athlete, scholar, <i>arbiter
elegantiarum&mdash;nec pluribus impar</i>. Cricket had a great deal to
do with it&mdash;plenty of Eton men will remember the &ldquo;Great
Flim&rdquo; and his performance against Harrow&mdash;but I take credit
to myself for introducing him to a good tailor, showing him
the way about Town, and teaching him to distinguish good
wine from bad. Denver bothered little about him&mdash;he had too
many entanglements of his own and in addition was taken up
with Gerald, who by this time was making a prize fool of himself
at Oxford. As a matter of fact Peter never got on with his father,
he was a ruthless young critic of the paternal misdemeanours,
and his sympathy for his mother had a destructive effect upon
his sense of humour.</p>
<p>Denver, needless to say, was the last person to tolerate his
own failings in his offspring. It cost him a good deal of money
to extricate Gerald from the Oxford affair, and he was willing
enough to turn his other son over to me. Indeed, at the age
of seventeen, Peter came to me of his own accord. He was old
for his age and exceedingly reasonable, and I treated him as a
man of the world. I established him in trustworthy hands in
Paris, instructing him to keep his affairs upon a sound business
footing and to see that they terminated with goodwill on both
sides and generosity on his. He fully justified my confidence.
I believe that no woman has ever found cause to complain of
Peter&rsquo;s treatment; and two at least of them have since married
royalty (rather obscure royalties, I admit, but royalty of a sort).
Here again, I insist upon my due share of the credit; however
good the material one has to work upon it is ridiculous to leave
any young man&rsquo;s social education to chance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</div>
<p>The Peter of this period was really charming, very frank,
modest and well-mannered, with a pretty, lively wit. In 1909
he went up with a scholarship to read History at Balliol, and
here, I must confess, he became rather intolerable. The world
was at his feet, and he began to give himself airs. He acquired
affectations, an exaggerated Oxford manner and a monocle,
and aired his opinions a good deal, both in and out of the
Union, though I will do him the justice to say that he never
attempted to patronise his mother or me. He was in his second
year when Denver broke his neck out hunting and Gerald
succeeded to the title. Gerald showed more sense of responsibility
than I had expected in dealing with the estate; his worst
mistake was to marry his cousin Helen, a scrawny, over-bred
prude, all country from head to heel. She and Peter loathed
each other cordially; but he could always take refuge with his
mother at the Dower House.</p>
<p>And then, in his last year at Oxford, Peter fell in love
with a child of seventeen and instantly forgot everything he
had ever been taught. He treated that girl as if she was made
of gossamer, and me as a hardened old monster of depravity
who had made him unfit to touch her delicate purity. I won&rsquo;t
deny that they made an exquisite pair&mdash;all white and gold&mdash;a
prince and princess of moonlight, people said. Moonshine
would have been nearer the mark. What Peter was to do in
twenty years&rsquo; time with a wife who had neither brains nor
character nobody but his mother and myself ever troubled to
ask, and he, of course, was completely besotted. Happily, Barbara&rsquo;s
parents decided that she was too young to marry; so Peter
went in for his final Schools in the temper of a Sir Eglamore
achieving his first dragon; laid his First-Class Honours at his
lady&rsquo;s feet like the dragon&rsquo;s head, and settled down to a period
of virtuous probation.</p>
<p>Then came the War. Of course the young idiot was mad
to get married before he went. But his own honourable scruples
made him mere wax in other people&rsquo;s hands. It was pointed
out to him that if he came back mutilated it would be very
unfair to the girl. He hadn&rsquo;t thought of that, and rushed off
in a frenzy of self-abnegation to release her from the engagement.
I had no hand in that; I was glad enough of the result,
but I couldn&rsquo;t stomach the means.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_ix">ix</div>
<p>He did very well in France; he made a good officer and
the men liked him. And then, if you please, he came back on
leave with his captaincy in &rsquo;16, to find the girl married&mdash;to a
hard-bitten rake of a Major Somebody, whom she had nursed
in the V.A.D. hospital, and whose motto with women was
catch &rsquo;em quick and treat &rsquo;em rough. It was pretty brutal; for
the girl hadn&rsquo;t had the nerve to tell Peter beforehand. They
got married in a hurry when they heard he was coming home,
and all he got on landing was a letter, announcing the <i>fait
accompli</i> and reminding him that he had set her free himself.</p>
<p>I will say for Peter that he came straight to me and admitted
that he had been a fool. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had your
lesson. Don&rsquo;t go and make a fool of yourself in the other
direction.&rdquo; So he went back to his job with (I am sure) the
fixed intention of getting killed; but all he got was his majority
and his D.S.O. for some recklessly good intelligence work
behind the German front. In 1918 he was blown up and buried
in a shell-hole near Caudry, and that left him with a bad
nervous breakdown, lasting, on and off, for two years. After
that, he set himself up in a flat in Piccadilly, with the man
Bunter (who had been his sergeant and was, and is, devoted
to him), and started out to put himself together again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind saying that I was prepared for almost anything.
He had lost all his beautiful frankness, he shut everybody
out of his confidence, including his mother and me, adopted
an impenetrable frivolity of manner and a dilettante pose, and
became, in fact, the complete comedian. He was wealthy and
could do as he chose, and it gave me a certain amount of
sardonic entertainment to watch the efforts of post-war feminine
London to capture him. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said one solicitous
matron, &ldquo;be good for poor Peter to live like a hermit.&rdquo; &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;if he did, it wouldn&rsquo;t be.&rdquo; No; from that point
of view he gave me no anxiety. But I could not but think it
dangerous that a man of his ability should have no job to occupy
his mind, and I told him so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_x">x</div>
<p>In 1921 came the business of the Attenbury Emeralds.
That affair has never been written up, but it made a good deal
of noise, even at that noisiest of periods. The trial of the thief
was a series of red-hot sensations, and the biggest sensation of
the bunch was when Lord Peter Wimsey walked into the
witness-box as chief witness for the prosecution.</p>
<p>That was notoriety with a vengeance. Actually, to an experienced
intelligence officer, I don&rsquo;t suppose the investigation
had offered any great difficulties; but a &ldquo;noble sleuth&rdquo; was
something new in thrills. Denver was furious; personally, I
didn&rsquo;t mind what Peter did, provided he did something. I thought
he seemed happier for the work, and I liked the Scotland Yard
man he had picked up during the run of the case. Charles
Parker is a quiet, sensible, well-bred fellow, and has been a
good friend and brother-in-law to Peter. He has the valuable
quality of being fond of people without wanting to turn them
inside out.</p>
<p>The only trouble about Peter&rsquo;s new hobby was that it had
to be more than a hobby, if it was to be any hobby for a
gentleman. You cannot get murderers hanged for your private
entertainment. Peter&rsquo;s intellect pulled him one way and his
nerves another, till I began to be afraid they would pull him
to pieces. At the end of every case we had the old nightmares
and shell-shock over again. And then Denver, of all people&mdash;Denver,
the crashing great booby, in the middle of his fulminations
against Peter&rsquo;s degrading and notorious police activities,
must needs get himself indicted on a murder charge and
stand his trial in the House of Lords, amid a blaze of publicity
which made all Peter&rsquo;s efforts in that direction look like damp
squibs.</p>
<p>Peter pulled his brother out of that mess, and, to my relief,
was human enough to get drunk on the strength of it. He now
admits that his &ldquo;hobby&rdquo; is his legitimate work for society, and
has developed sufficient interest in public affairs to undertake
small diplomatic jobs from time to time under the Foreign
Office. Of late he has become a little more ready to show his
feelings, and a little less terrified of having any to show.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</div>
<p>His latest eccentricity has been to fall in love with that
girl whom he cleared of the charge of poisoning her lover. She
refused to marry him, as any woman of character would. Gratitude
and a humiliating inferiority complex are no foundation
for matrimony; the position was false from the start. Peter had
the sense, this time, to take my advice. &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what
was wrong for you twenty years back is right now. It&rsquo;s not the
innocent young things that need gentle handling&mdash;it&rsquo;s the ones
that have been frightened and hurt. Begin again from the beginning&mdash;I
warn you that you will need all the self-discipline
you have ever learnt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, he has tried. I don&rsquo;t think I have ever seen such
patience. The girl has brains and character and honesty; but
he has got to teach her how to take, which is far more difficult
than learning to give. I think they will find one another, if
they can keep their passions from running ahead of their wills.
He does realise, I know, that in this case there can be no consent
but free consent.</p>
<p>Peter is forty-five now, it is really time he was settled. As
you will see, I have been one of the important formative influences
in his career, and on the whole, I feel he does me
credit. He is a true Delagardie, with little of the Wimseys about
him except (I must be fair) that underlying sense of social
responsibility which prevents the English landed gentry from
being a total loss, spiritually speaking. Detective or no detective,
he is a scholar and a gentleman; it will amuse me to see what
sort of shot he makes at being a husband and father. I am
getting an old man, and have no son of my own (that I know
of); I should be glad to see Peter happy. But as his mother
says, &ldquo;Peter has always had everything except the things he
really wanted,&rdquo; and I suppose he is luckier than most.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The death was certainly sudden, unexpected, and to me
mysterious.</i>&rdquo;
<span class="jr"><i>Letter from Dr. Paterson to the Registrar in the case of Reg. v. Pritchard</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;But if he thought the woman was being murdered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Charles,&rdquo; said the young man with the monocle,
&ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t do for people, especially doctors, to go about &lsquo;thinking&rsquo;
things. They may get into frightful trouble. In Pritchard&rsquo;s
case, I consider Dr. Paterson did all he reasonably could by
refusing a certificate for Mrs. Taylor and sending that uncommonly
disquieting letter to the Registrar. He couldn&rsquo;t help the
man&rsquo;s being a fool. If there had only been an inquest on Mrs.
Taylor, Pritchard would probably have been frightened off and
left his wife alone. After all, Paterson hadn&rsquo;t a spark of real
evidence. And suppose he&rsquo;d been quite wrong&mdash;what a dust-up
there&rsquo;d have been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; urged the nondescript young man, dubiously
extracting a bubbling-hot Helix Pomatia from its shell,
and eyeing it nervously before putting it in his mouth, &ldquo;surely
it&rsquo;s a clear case of public duty to voice one&rsquo;s suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of <i>your</i> duty&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;By the way, it&rsquo;s not
a public duty to eat snails if you don&rsquo;t like &rsquo;em. No, I thought
you didn&rsquo;t. Why wrestle with a harsh fate any longer? Waiter,
take the gentleman&rsquo;s snails away and bring oysters instead.&nbsp;..&nbsp;..&nbsp;.
No&mdash;as I was saying, it may be part of <i>your</i> duty to have
suspicions and invite investigation and generally raise hell for
everybody, and if you&rsquo;re mistaken nobody says much, beyond
that you&rsquo;re a smart, painstaking officer though a little over-zealous.
But doctors, poor devils! are everlastingly walking a
kind of social tight-rope. People don&rsquo;t fancy calling in a man
who&rsquo;s liable to bring out accusations of murder on the smallest
provocation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thin-faced young man sitting alone at the next table
had turned round eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s frightfully rude of me to break in, but every word you
say is absolutely true, and mine is a case in point. A doctor&mdash;you
can&rsquo;t have any idea how dependent he is on the fancies
and prejudices of his patients. They resent the most elementary
precautions. If you dare to suggest a post-mortem, they&rsquo;re up
in arms at the idea of &lsquo;cutting poor dear So-and-so up,&rsquo; and
even if you only ask permission to investigate an obscure disease
in the interests of research, they imagine you&rsquo;re hinting at
something unpleasant. Of course, if you let things go, and it
turns out afterwards there&rsquo;s been any jiggery-pokery, the coroner
jumps down your throat and the newspapers make a butt of
you, and, whichever way it is, you wish you&rsquo;d never been born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak with personal feeling,&rdquo; said the man with the
monocle, with an agreeable air of interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said the thin-faced man, emphatically. &ldquo;If I had
behaved like a man of the world instead of a zealous citizen,
I shouldn&rsquo;t be hunting about for a new job today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man with the monocle glanced round the little Soho
restaurant with a faint smile. The fat man on their right was
unctuously entertaining two ladies of the chorus; beyond him,
two elderly habitu&eacute;s were showing their acquaintance with
the fare at the &ldquo;Au Bon Bourgeois&rdquo; by consuming a Tripes
&agrave; la Mode de Caen (which they do very excellently there)
and a bottle of Chablis Moutonne 1916; on the other side
of the room a provincial and his wife were stupidly clamouring
for a cut off the joint with lemonade for the lady and whisky
and soda for the gentleman, while at the adjoining table, the
handsome silver-haired proprietor, absorbed in fatiguing a
salad for a family party, had for the moment no thoughts
beyond the nice adjustment of the chopped herbs and garlic.
The head waiter, presenting for inspection a plate of Blue
River Trout, helped the monocled man and his companion
and retired, leaving them in the privacy which unsophisticated
people always seek in genteel tea-shops and never, never find
there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;I feel,&rdquo; said the monocled man, &ldquo;exactly like Prince Florizel
of Bohemia. I am confident that you, sir, have an interesting
story to relate, and shall be greatly obliged if you will
favour us with the recital. I perceive that you have finished
your dinner, and it will therefore perhaps not be disagreeable
to you to remove to this table and entertain us with your story
while we eat. Pardon my Stevensonian manner&mdash;my sympathy
is none the less sincere on that account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an ass, Peter,&rdquo; said the nondescript man. &ldquo;My
friend is a much more rational person than you might suppose
to hear him talk,&rdquo; he added, turning to the stranger, &ldquo;and if
there&rsquo;s anything you&rsquo;d like to get off your chest, you may be
perfectly certain it won&rsquo;t go any farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other smiled a little grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about it with pleasure if it won&rsquo;t bore you. It
just happens to be a case in point, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On <i>my</i> side of the argument,&rdquo; said the man called Peter,
with triumph. &ldquo;Do carry on. Have something to drink. It&rsquo;s a
poor heart that never rejoices. And begin right at the beginning,
if you will, please. I have a very trivial mind. Detail delights
me. Ramifications enchant me. Distance no object. No reasonable
offer refused. Charles here will say the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;to begin from the very beginning,
I am a medical man, particularly interested in the subject
of cancer. I had hoped, as so many people do, to specialise on
the subject, but there wasn&rsquo;t money enough, when I&rsquo;d done
my exams., to allow me to settle down to research work. I had
to take a country practice, but I kept in touch with the important
men up here, hoping to be able to come back to it some day.
I may say I have quite decent expectations from an uncle, and
in the meanwhile they agreed it would be quite good for me
to get some all-round experience as a GP. Keeps one from
getting narrow and all that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Consequently, when I bought a nice little practice at&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&mdash;I&rsquo;d
better not mention any names, let&rsquo;s call it X, down Hampshire
way, a little country town of about 5,000 people&mdash;I was
greatly pleased to find a cancer case on my list of patients. The
old lady&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long ago was this?&rdquo; interrupted Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three years ago. There wasn&rsquo;t much to be done with
the case. The old lady was seventy-two, and had already had
one operation. She was a game old girl, though, and was
making a good fight of it, with a very tough constitution to
back her up. She was not, I should say, and had never been,
a woman of very powerful intellect or strong character as far
as her dealings with other people went, but she was extremely
obstinate in certain ways and was possessed by a positive
determination not to die. At this time she lived alone with
her niece, a young woman of twenty-five or so. Previously
to that, she had been living with another old lady, the girl&rsquo;s
aunt on the other side of the family, who had been her
devoted friend since their school days. When this other old
aunt died, the girl, who was their only living relative, threw
up her job as a nurse at the Royal Free Hospital to look after
the survivor&mdash;my patient&mdash;and they had come and settled
down at X about a year before I took over the practice. I
hope I am making myself clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly. Was there another nurse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at that time. The patient was able to get about, visit
acquaintances, do light work about the house, flowers and
knitting and reading and so on, and to drive about the place&mdash;in
fact, most of the things that old ladies do occupy their time
with. Of course, she had her bad days of pain from time to
time, but the niece&rsquo;s training was quite sufficient to enable her
to do all that was necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the niece like?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a very nice, well-educated, capable girl, with a
great deal more brain than her aunt. Self-reliant, cool, all
that sort of thing. Quite the modern type. The sort of woman
one can trust to keep her head and not forget things. Of
course, after a time, the wretched growth made its appearance
again, as it always does if it isn&rsquo;t tackled at the very beginning,
and another operation became necessary. That was when I
had been in X about eight months. I took her up to London,
to my own old chief, Sir Warburton Giles, and it was performed
very successfully as far as the operation itself went,
though it was then only too evident that a vital organ was
being encroached upon, and that the end could only be a
matter of time. I needn&rsquo;t go into details. Everything was done
that could be done. I wanted the old lady to stay in town
under Sir Warburton&rsquo;s eye, but she was vigorously opposed
to this. She was accustomed to a country life and could not
be happy except in her own home. So she went back to X,
and I was able to keep her going with visits for treatment at
the nearest large town, where there is an excellent hospital.
She rallied amazingly after the operation and eventually was
able to dismiss her nurse and go on in the old way under
the care of the niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, doctor,&rdquo; put in the man called Charles,
&ldquo;you say you took her to Sir Warburton Giles and so on. I
gather she was pretty well off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she was quite a wealthy woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to know whether she made a will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I think I mentioned her extreme aversion to the idea
of death. She had always refused to make any kind of will
because it upset her to think about such things. I did once
venture to speak of the subject in the most casual way I could,
shortly before she underwent her operation, but the effect was
to excite her very undesirably. Also she said, which was quite
true, that it was quite unnecessary. &lsquo;You, my dear,&rsquo; she said to
the niece, &lsquo;are the only kith and kin I&rsquo;ve got in the world, and
all I&rsquo;ve got will be yours some day, whatever happens. I know
I can trust you to remember my servants and my little charities.&rsquo;
So, of course, I didn&rsquo;t insist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember, by the way&mdash;but that was a good deal later
on and has nothing to do with the story&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Please</i>,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;<i>all</i> the details.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I remember going there one day and finding my
patient not so well as I could have wished and very much
agitated. The niece told me that the trouble was caused by a
visit from her solicitor&mdash;a family lawyer from her home town,
not our local man. He had insisted on a private interview with
the old lady, at the close of which she had appeared terribly
excited and angry, declaring that everyone was in a conspiracy
to kill her before her time. The solicitor, before leaving, had
given no explanation to the niece, but had impressed upon her
that if at any time her aunt expressed a wish to see him, she
was to send for him at any hour of the day or night and he
would come at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was he ever sent for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The old lady was deeply offended with him, and
almost the last bit of business she did for herself was to take
her affairs out of his hands and transfer them to the local
solicitor. Shortly afterwards, a third operation became necessary,
and after this she gradually became more and more of an
invalid. Her head began to get weak, too, and she grew incapable
of understanding anything complicated, and indeed
she was in too much pain to be bothered about business. The
niece had a power of attorney, and took over the management
of her aunt&rsquo;s money entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In April, 1925. Mind you, though she was getting a bit
&lsquo;gaga&rsquo;&mdash;after all, she was getting on in years&mdash;her bodily strength
was quite remarkable. I was investigating a new method of
treatment and the results were extraordinarily interesting. That
made it all the more annoying to me when the surprising thing
happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should mention that by this time we were obliged to
have an outside nurse for her, as the niece could not do both
the day and night duty. The first nurse came in April. She was
a most charming and capable young woman&mdash;the ideal nurse.
I placed absolute dependence on her. She had been specially
recommended to me by Sir Warburton Giles, and though she
was not then more than twenty-eight, she had the discretion
and judgment of a woman twice her age. I may as well tell
you at once that I became deeply attached to this lady and she
to me. We are engaged, and had hoped to be married this
year&mdash;if it hadn&rsquo;t been for my damned conscientiousness and
public spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The doctor grimaced wryly at Charles, who murmured
rather lamely that it was very bad luck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fianc&eacute;e, like myself, took a keen interest in the case&mdash;partly
because it was my case and partly because she was herself
greatly interested in the disease. She looks forward to being of
great assistance to me in my life work if I ever get the chance
to do anything at it. But that&rsquo;s by the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things went on like this till September. Then, for some
reason, the patient began to take one of those unaccountable
dislikes that feeble-minded patients do take sometimes. She got
it into her head that the nurse wanted to kill her&mdash;the same
idea she&rsquo;d had about the lawyer, you see&mdash;and earnestly assured
her niece that she was being poisoned. No doubt she attributed
her attacks of pain to this cause. Reasoning was useless&mdash;she
cried out and refused to let the nurse come near her. When
that happens, naturally, there&rsquo;s nothing for it but to get rid of
the nurse, as she can do the patient no possible good. I sent
my fianc&eacute;e back to town and wired to Sir Warburton&rsquo;s Clinic
to send me down another nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new nurse arrived the next day. Naturally, after the
other, she was a second-best as far as I was concerned, but she
seemed quite up to her work and the patient made no objection.
However, now I began to have trouble with the niece. Poor
girl, all this long-drawn-out business was getting on her nerves,
I suppose. She took it into her head that her aunt was very
much worse. I said that of course she must gradually get worse,
but that she was putting up a wonderful fight and there was
no cause for alarm. The girl wasn&rsquo;t satisfied, however, and on
one occasion early in November sent for me hurriedly in the
middle of the night because her aunt was dying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I arrived, I found the patient in great pain,
certainly, but in no immediate danger. I told the nurse to
give her a morphia injection, and administered a dose of
bromide to the girl, telling her to go to bed and not to do
any nursing for the next few days. The following day I
overhauled the patient very carefully and found that she was
doing even better than I supposed. Her heart was exceptionally
strong and steady, she was taking nourishment remarkably
well and the progress of the disease was temporarily arrested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;The niece apologised for her agitation, and said she
really thought her aunt was going. I said that, on the contrary,
I could now affirm positively that she would live for another
five or six months. As you know, in cases like hers, one can
speak with very fair certainty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In any case,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t distress yourself too
much. Death, when it does come, will be a release from
suffering.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;poor Auntie. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m selfish, but
she&rsquo;s the only relative I have left in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three days later, I was just sitting down to dinner when
a telephone message came. Would I go over at once? The
patient was dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; cried Charles, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s perfectly obvious&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Sherlock,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;the doctor&rsquo;s story is
not going to be obvious. Far from it, as the private said when
he aimed at the bull&rsquo;s-eye and hit the gunnery instructor. But
I observe the waiter hovering uneasily about us while his colleagues
pile up chairs and carry away the cruets. Will you not
come and finish the story in my flat? I can give you a glass of
very decent port. You will? Good. Waiter, call a taxi&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 110A
Piccadilly.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p class="tb">The April night was clear and chilly, and a brisk wood fire
burned in a welcoming manner on the hearth. The bookcases
which lined the walls were filled with rich old calf bindings,
mellow and glowing in the lamp-light. There was a grand
piano, open, a huge chesterfield piled deep with cushions and
two arm-chairs of the build that invites one to wallow. The
port was brought in by an impressive man-servant and placed
on a very beautiful little Chippendale table. Some big bowls
of scarlet and yellow parrot tulips beckoned, banner-like, from
dark corners.</p>
<p>The doctor had just written his new acquaintance down
as an &aelig;sthete with a literary turn, looking for the ingredients
of a human drama, when the man-servant re-entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inspector Sugg rang up, my lord, and left this message,
and said would you be good enough to give him a call as soon
as you came in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did he?&mdash;well, just get him for me, would you? This
is the Worplesham business, Charles. Sugg&rsquo;s mucked it up as
usual. The baker has an alibi&mdash;naturally&mdash;he would have.
Oh, thanks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hullo! that you, Inspector? What did I tell
you?&mdash;Oh, routine be hanged. Now, look here. You get hold
of that gamekeeper fellow, and find out from him what he saw
in the sand-pit.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, I know, but I fancy if you ask him
impressively enough he will come across with it. No, of course
not&mdash;if you ask if he was there, he&rsquo;ll say no. Say you know
he was there and what did he see&mdash;and, look here! if he hums
and haws about it, say you&rsquo;re sending a gang down to have the
stream diverted.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All right. Not at all. Let me know if anything
comes of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>He put the receiver down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, doctor. A little matter of business. Now go
on with your story. The old lady was dead, eh? Died in her
sleep, I suppose. Passed away in the most innocent manner
possible. Everything all ship-shape and Bristol-fashion. No
struggle, no wounds, h&aelig;morrhages, or obvious symptoms, naturally,
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. She had taken some nourishment at 6 o&rsquo;clock&mdash;a
little broth and some milk pudding. At eight, the nurse gave
her a morphine injection and then went straight out to put
some bowls of flowers on the little table on the landing for the
night. The maid came to speak to her about some arrangements
for the next day, and while they were talking, Miss&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that is,
the niece&mdash;came up and went into her aunt&rsquo;s room. She had
only been there a moment or two when she cried out, &lsquo;Nurse!
Nurse!&rsquo; The nurse rushed in, and found the patient dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, my first idea was that by some accident a
double dose of morphine had been administered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely that wouldn&rsquo;t have acted so promptly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but I thought that a deep coma might have been
mistaken for death. However, the nurse assured me that this
was not the case, and, as a matter of fact, the possibility was
completely disproved, as we were able to count the ampull&aelig;
of morphine and found them all satisfactorily accounted for.
There were no signs of the patient having tried to move or
strain herself, or of her having knocked against anything. The
little night-table was pushed aside, but that had been done by
the niece when she came in and was struck by her aunt&rsquo;s
alarmingly lifeless appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the broth and the milk pudding?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;That occurred to me, also&mdash;not in any sinister way, but
to wonder whether she&rsquo;d been having too much&mdash;distended
stomach&mdash;pressure on the heart, and that sort of thing. However,
when I came to look into it, it seemed very unlikely. The
quantity was so small, and on the face of it, two hours were
sufficient for digestion&mdash;if it had been that, death would have
taken place earlier. I was completely puzzled, and so was the
nurse. Indeed, she was very much upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the niece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The niece could say nothing but &lsquo;I told you so, I told
you so&mdash;I knew she was worse than you thought.&rsquo; Well, to cut
a long story short, I was so bothered with my pet patient going
off like that, that next morning, after I had thought the matter
over, I asked for a post-mortem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any difficulty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest. A little natural distaste, of course, but
no sort of opposition. I explained that I felt sure there must be
some obscure morbid condition which I had failed to diagnose
and that I should feel more satisfied if I might make an investigation.
The only thing which seemed to trouble the niece
was the thought of an inquest. I said&mdash;rather unwisely, I suppose,
according to general rules&mdash;that I didn&rsquo;t think an inquest
would be necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you offered to perform the post-mortem yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I made no doubt that I should find a sufficient cause
of death to enable me to give a certificate. I had one bit of
luck, and that was that the old lady had at some time or the
other expressed in a general way an opinion in favour of cremation,
and the niece wished this to be carried out. This meant
getting a man with special qualifications to sign the certificate
with me, so I persuaded this other doctor to come and help
me to do the autopsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you find anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing. The other man, of course, said I was a fool
to kick up a fuss. He thought that as the old lady was certainly
dying in any case, it would be quite enough to put in, Cause
of death, cancer; immediate cause, heart failure, and leave it
at that. But I was a damned conscientious ass, and said I wasn&rsquo;t
satisfied. There was absolutely nothing about the body to explain
the death naturally, and I insisted on an analysis.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you actually suspect&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, not exactly. But&mdash;well, I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied. By
the way, it was very clear at the autopsy that the morphine had
nothing to do with it. Death had occurred so soon after the
injection that the drug had only partially dispersed from the
arm. Now I think it over, I suppose it must have been shock,
somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the analysis privately made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but of course the funeral was held up and things got
round. The coroner heard about it and started to make inquiries,
and the nurse, who got it into her head that I was
accusing her of neglect or something, behaved in a very unprofessional
way and created a lot of talk and trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nothing came of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. There was no trace of poison or anything of
that sort, and the analysis left us exactly where we were. Naturally,
I began to think I had made a ghastly exhibition of
myself. Rather against my own professional judgment, I signed
the certificate&mdash;heart failure following on shock, and my patient
was finally got into her grave after a week of worry, without
an inquest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. That was another scandal. The crematorium
authorities, who are pretty particular, heard about the fuss and
refused to act in the matter, so the body is filed in the church-yard
for reference if necessary. There was a huge attendance
at the funeral and a great deal of sympathy for the niece. The
next day I got a note from one of my most influential patients,
saying that my professional services would no longer be required.
The day after that, I was avoided in the street by the
Mayor&rsquo;s wife. Presently I found my practice dropping away
from me, and discovered I was getting known as &lsquo;the man who
practically accused that charming Miss So-and-so of murder.&rsquo;
Sometimes it was the niece I was supposed to be accusing.
Sometimes it was &lsquo;that nice Nurse&mdash;not the flighty one who
was dismissed, the other one, you know.&rsquo; Another version was,
that I had tried to get the nurse into trouble because I resented
the dismissal of my fianc&eacute;e. Finally, I heard a rumour that the
patient had discovered me &lsquo;canoodling&rsquo;&mdash;that was the beastly
word&mdash;with my fianc&eacute;e, instead of doing my job, and had
done away with the old lady myself out of revenge&mdash;though
why, in that case, I should have refused a certificate, my scandal-mongers
didn&rsquo;t trouble to explain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;I stuck it out for a year, but my position became intolerable.
The practice dwindled to practically nothing, so I sold
it, took a holiday to get the taste out of my mouth&mdash;and here
I am, looking for another opening. So that&rsquo;s that&mdash;and the
moral is, Don&rsquo;t be officious about public duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor gave an irritated laugh, and flung himself back
in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he added, combatantly, &ldquo;the cats! Confusion
to &rsquo;em!&rdquo; and he drained his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; agreed his host. He sat for a few moments
looking thoughtfully into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, suddenly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling rather
interested by this case. I have a sensation of internal gloating
which assures me that there is something to be investigated.
That feeling has never failed me yet&mdash;I trust it never will. It
warned me the other day to look into my income-tax assessment,
and I discovered that I had been paying about &pound;900 too
much for the last three years. It urged me only last week to
ask a bloke who was preparing to drive me over the Horseshoe
Pass whether he had any petrol in the tank, and he discovered
he had just about a pint&mdash;enough to get us nicely half-way
round. It&rsquo;s a very lonely spot. Of course, I knew the man, so
it wasn&rsquo;t <i>all</i> intuition. Still, I always make it a rule to investigate
anything I feel like investigating. I believe,&rdquo; he added, in a
reminiscent tone, &ldquo;I was a terror in my nursery days. Anyhow,
curious cases are rather a hobby of mine. In fact, I&rsquo;m not just
being the perfect listener. I have deceived you. I have an ulterior
motive, said he, throwing off his side-whiskers and disclosing
the well-known hollow jaws of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was beginning to have my suspicions,&rdquo; said the doctor,
after a short pause. &ldquo;I think you must be Lord Peter Wimsey.
I wondered why your face was so familiar, but of course it was
in all the papers a few years ago when you disentangled the
Riddlesdale Mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right. It&rsquo;s a silly kind of face, of course, but rather
disarming, don&rsquo;t you think? I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;d have chosen
it, but I do my best with it. I do hope it isn&rsquo;t contracting a
sleuth-like expression, or anything unpleasant. This is the real
sleuth&mdash;my friend Detective-Inspector Parker of Scotland Yard.
He&rsquo;s the one who really does the work. I make imbecile suggestions
and he does the work of elaborately disproving them.
Then, by a process of elimination, we find the right explanation,
and the world says, &lsquo;My god, what intuition that young
man has!&rsquo; Well, look here&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d like to have
a go at this. If you&rsquo;ll entrust me with your name and address
and the names of the parties concerned, I&rsquo;d like very much to
have a shot at looking into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor considered a moment, then shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you, but I think I&rsquo;d rather not. I&rsquo;ve got
into enough bothers already. Anyway, it isn&rsquo;t professional to
talk, and if I stirred up any more fuss, I should probably have
to chuck this country altogether and end up as one of those
drunken ship&rsquo;s doctors in the South Seas or somewhere, who
are always telling their life-history to people and delivering
awful warnings. Better to let sleeping dogs lie. Thanks very
much, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you like,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll think it over, and if
any useful suggestion occurs to me, I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you,&rdquo; replied the visitor, absently, taking
his hat and stick from the man-servant, who had answered
Wimsey&rsquo;s ring. &ldquo;Well, good night, and many thanks for hearing
me so patiently. By the way, though,&rdquo; he added, turning suddenly
at the door, &ldquo;how do you propose to let me know when
you haven&rsquo;t got my name and address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Hawkshaw, the detective,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and you
shall hear from me anyhow before the end of the week.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br><span class="h2line2">A Use for Spinsters</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>There are two million more females than males in
England and Wales! And this is an awe-inspiring
circumstance.</i>&rdquo;
<span class="jr">Gilbert Frankau</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;What do you really think of that story?&rdquo; inquired Parker. He
had dropped in to breakfast with Wimsey the next morning,
before departing in the Notting Dale direction, in quest of an
elusive anonymous letter-writer. &ldquo;I thought it sounded rather
as though our friend had been a bit too cocksure about his
grand medical specialising. After all, the old girl might so easily
have had some sort of heart attack. She was very old and ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she might, though I believe as a matter of fact cancer
patients very seldom pop off in that unexpected way. As a rule,
they surprise everybody by the way they cling to life. Still, I
wouldn&rsquo;t think much of that if it wasn&rsquo;t for the niece. She
prepared the way for the death, you see, by describing her aunt
as so much worse than she was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the same when the doctor was telling his tale.
But what did the niece do? She can&rsquo;t have poisoned her aunt
or even smothered her, I suppose, or they&rsquo;d have found signs
of it on the body. And the aunt <i>did</i> die&mdash;so perhaps the niece
was right and the opinionated young medico wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so. And of course, we&rsquo;ve only got his version of the
niece and the nurse&mdash;and he obviously had what the Scotch
call ta&rsquo;en a scunner at the nurse. We mustn&rsquo;t lose sight of her,
by the way. She was the last person to be with the old lady
before her death, and it was she who administered that injection.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;but the injection had nothing to do with it. If
anything&rsquo;s clear, that is. I say, do you think the nurse can have
said anything that agitated the old lady and gave her a shock
that way. The patient was a bit gaga, but she may have had
sense enough to understand something really startling. Possibly
the nurse just said something stupid about dying&mdash;the old lady
appears to have been very sensitive on the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Lord Peter, &ldquo;I was waiting for you to get on to
that. Have you realised that there really is one rather sinister
figure in the story, and that&rsquo;s the family lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one who came down to say something about the
will, you mean, and was so abruptly sent packing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Suppose he&rsquo;d wanted the patient to make a will in
favour of somebody quite different&mdash;somebody outside the story
as we know it. And when he found he couldn&rsquo;t get any attention
paid to him, he sent the new nurse down as a sort of substitute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be rather an elaborate plot,&rdquo; said Parker, dubiously.
&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t know that the doctor&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e was going
to be sent away. Unless he was in league with the niece, of
course, and induced her to engineer the change of nurses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That cock won&rsquo;t fight, Charles. The niece wouldn&rsquo;t be
in league with the lawyer to get herself disinherited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not. Still, I think there&rsquo;s something in the
idea that the old girl was either accidentally or deliberately
startled to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and whichever way it was, it probably wasn&rsquo;t legal
murder in that case. However, I think it&rsquo;s worth looking into.
That reminds me.&rdquo; He rang the bell. &ldquo;Bunter, just take a note
to the post for me, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter drew a writing pad towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to write?&rdquo; asked Parker, looking over
his shoulder with some amusement.</p>
<p>Lord Peter wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t civilisation wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He signed this simple message and slipped it into an envelope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to be immune from silly letters, Charles,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t carry your monomark in your hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;And what do you propose to do next?&rdquo; asked Parker. &ldquo;Not,
I hope, to send me round to Monomark House to get the name
of a client. I couldn&rsquo;t do that without official authority, and
they would probably kick up an awful shindy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied his friend, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t propose violating the
secrets of the confessional. Not in that quarter at any rate. I
think, if you can spare a moment from your mysterious correspondent,
who probably does not intend to be found, I will
ask you to come and pay a visit to a friend of mine. It won&rsquo;t
take long. I think you&rsquo;ll be interested. I&mdash;in fact, you&rsquo;ll be the
first person I&rsquo;ve ever taken to see her. She will be very much
touched and pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed a little self-consciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Parker, embarrassed. Although the men were
great friends, Wimsey had always preserved a reticence about
his personal affairs&mdash;not so much by concealing as by ignoring
them. This revelation seemed to mark a new stage of intimacy,
and Parker was not sure that he liked it. He conducted his own
life with an earnest middle-class morality which he owed to
his birth and up-bringing, and, while theoretically recognising
that Lord Peter&rsquo;s world acknowledged different standards, he
had never contemplated being personally faced with any result
of their application in practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;rather an experiment,&rdquo; Wimsey was saying a trifle shyly;
&ldquo;anyway, she&rsquo;s quite comfortably fixed in a little flat in Pimlico.
You can come, can&rsquo;t you, Charles? I really should like you
two to meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, rather,&rdquo; said Parker, hastily, &ldquo;I should like to
very much. Er&mdash;how long&mdash;I mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the arrangement&rsquo;s only been going a few months,&rdquo;
said Wimsey, leading the way to the lift, &ldquo;but it really seems
to be working out quite satisfactorily. Of course, it makes things
much easier for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, as you&rsquo;ll understand&mdash;I won&rsquo;t go into it all
till we get there, and then you&rsquo;ll see for yourself,&rdquo; Wimsey
chattered on, slamming the gates of the lift with unnecessary
violence&mdash;&ldquo;but, as I was saying, you&rsquo;ll observe it&rsquo;s quite a new
departure. I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s ever been anything exactly
like it before. Of course, there&rsquo;s nothing new under the sun,
as Solomon said, but after all, I daresay all those wives and
porcupines, as the child said, must have soured his disposition
a little, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;Poor fish,&rdquo; he added to himself,
&ldquo;they <i>always</i> seem to think it&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outlet,&rdquo; said Wimsey, energetically, &ldquo;hi! taxi!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. outlet&mdash;everybody
needs an outlet&mdash;97<span class="small">A</span>, St. George&rsquo;s Square&mdash;and
after all, one can&rsquo;t really blame people if it&rsquo;s just that they
need an outlet. I mean, why be bitter? They can&rsquo;t help it. I
think it&rsquo;s much kinder to give them an outlet than to make fun
of them in books&mdash;and, after all, it isn&rsquo;t really difficult to write
books. Especially if you either write a rotten story in good
English or a good story in rotten English, which is as far as
most people seem to get nowadays. Don&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker agreed, and Lord Peter wandered away along
the paths of literature, till the cab stopped before one of those
tall, awkward mansions which, originally designed for a Victorian
family with fatigue-proof servants, have lately been dissected
each into half a dozen inconvenient band-boxes and let
off in flats.</p>
<p>Lord Peter rang the top bell, which was marked <span class="small">CLIMPSON</span>,
and relaxed negligently against the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six flights of stairs,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;it takes her some time
to answer the bell, because there&rsquo;s no lift, you see. She wouldn&rsquo;t
have a more expensive flat, though. She thought it wouldn&rsquo;t
be suitable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Mr. Parker was greatly relieved, if somewhat surprised, by
the modesty of the lady&rsquo;s demands, and, placing his foot on
the door-scraper in an easy attitude, prepared to wait with
patience. Before many minutes, however, the door was opened
by a thin, middle-aged woman, with a sharp, sallow face and
very vivacious manner. She wore a neat, dark coat and skirt,
a high-necked blouse and a long gold neck-chain with a variety
of small ornaments dangling from it at intervals, and her iron-grey
hair was dressed under a net, in the style fashionable in
the reign of the late King Edward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord Peter! How very nice to see you. Rather an
<i>early</i> visit, but I&rsquo;m sure you will excuse the sitting-room being
a trifle in disorder. <i>Do</i> come in. The lists are <i>quite</i> ready for
you. I finished them last night. In fact, I was just about to put
on my hat and bring them round to you. I do <i>hope</i> you don&rsquo;t
think I have taken an <i>unconscionable</i> time, but there was a
quite <i>surprising</i> number of entries. It is <i>too</i> good of you to
trouble to call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, Miss Climpson. This is my friend, Detective-Inspector
Parker, whom I have mentioned to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Parker&mdash;or ought I to say Inspector?
Excuse me if I make mistakes&mdash;this is really the first time I
have been in the hands of the police. I hope it&rsquo;s not rude of
me to say that. Please come up. A great many stairs, I am
afraid, but I hope you do not mind. I do so like to be <i>high up</i>.
The air is so much better, and you know, Mr. Parker, thanks
to Lord Peter&rsquo;s great kindness, I have such a <i>beautiful, airy</i>
view, right over the houses. I think one can work so much
<i>better</i> when one doesn&rsquo;t feel cribbed, cabined and confined,
as Hamlet says. Dear me! Mrs. Winbottle <i>will</i> leave the pail
on the stairs, and always in that very dark corner. I am <i>continually</i>
telling her about it. If you keep close to the banisters
you will avoid it nicely. Only one more flight. Here we are.
Please overlook the untidiness. I always think breakfast things
look so <i>ugly</i> when one has finished with them&mdash;almost sordid,
to use a nasty word for a nasty subject. What a pity that some
of these clever people can&rsquo;t invent <i>self-cleaning</i> and <i>self-clearing</i>
plates, is it not? But please <i>do</i> sit down; I won&rsquo;t keep you a
moment. And I know, Lord Peter, that you will not hesitate
to smoke. I do so enjoy the smell of your cigarettes&mdash;quite
delicious&mdash;and you are so <i>very</i> good about extinguishing the
ends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The little room was, as a matter of fact, most exquisitely
neat, in spite of the crowded array of knick-knacks and photographs
that adorned every available inch of space. The sole
evidences of dissipation were an empty eggshell, a used cup
and a crumby plate on a breakfast tray. Miss Climpson promptly
subdued this riot by carrying the tray bodily on to the landing.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker, a little bewildered, lowered himself cautiously
into a small arm-chair, embellished with a hard, fat little cushion
which made it impossible to lean back. Lord Peter wriggled
into the window-seat, lit a Sobriane and clasped his hands
above his knees. Miss Climpson, seated upright at the table,
gazed at him with a gratified air which was positively touching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have gone <i>very</i> carefully into all these cases,&rdquo; she began,
taking up a thick wad of type-script. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, indeed, my
notes are rather <i>copious</i>, but I trust the typist&rsquo;s bill will not be
considered too heavy. My handwriting is very clear, so I don&rsquo;t
think there can be any errors. Dear me! such <i>sad</i> stories some
of these poor women had to tell me! But I have investigated
most fully, with the kind assistance of the clergyman&mdash;a very
nice man and so helpful&mdash;and I feel sure that in the majority
of the cases your assistance will be <i>well bestowed</i>. If you would
like to go through&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at the moment, Miss Climpson,&rdquo; interrupted Lord
Peter, hurriedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Charles&mdash;nothing whatever to
do with Our Dumb Friends or supplying Flannel to Unmarried
Mothers. I&rsquo;ll tell you about it later. Just now, Miss Climpson,
we want your help on something quite different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Climpson produced a business-like notebook and sat
at attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inquiry divides itself into two parts,&rdquo; said Lord Peter.
&ldquo;The first part, I&rsquo;m afraid, is rather dull. I want you (if you
will be so good) to go down to Somerset House and search, or
get them to search, through all the death-certificates for Hampshire
in the month of November, 1925. I don&rsquo;t know the town
and I don&rsquo;t know the name of the deceased. What you are
looking for is the death-certificate of an old lady of 73; cause
of death, cancer; immediate cause, heart failure; and the certificate
will have been signed by two doctors, one of whom
will be either a Medical Officer of Health, Police Surgeon,
Certifying Surgeon under the Factory and Workshops Act,
Medical Referee under the Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Act,
Physician or Surgeon in a big General Hospital, or a man
specially appointed by the Cremation authorities. If you want
to give any excuse for the search, you can say that you are
compiling statistics about cancer; but what you really want is
the names of the people concerned and the name of the town.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose there are more than one answering to the requirements?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s where the second part comes in, and where
your remarkable tact and shrewdness are going to be so helpful
to us. When you have collected all the &lsquo;possibles,&rsquo; I shall ask
you to go down to each of the towns concerned and make very,
very skilful inquiries, to find out which is the case we want to
get on to. Of course, you mustn&rsquo;t appear to be inquiring. You
must find some good gossipy lady living in the neighbourhood
and just get her to talk in a natural way. You must pretend to
be gossipy yourself&mdash;it&rsquo;s not in your nature, I know, but I&rsquo;m
sure you can make a little pretense about it&mdash;and find out all
you can. I fancy you&rsquo;ll find it pretty easy if you once strike the
right town, because I know for a certainty that there was a
terrible lot of ill-natured talk about this particular death, and
it won&rsquo;t have been forgotten yet by a long chalk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall I know when it&rsquo;s the right one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you can spare the time, I want you to listen to
a little story. Mind you, Miss Climpson, when you get to
wherever it is, you are not supposed ever to have heard a word
of this tale before. But I needn&rsquo;t tell you that. Now, Charles,
you&rsquo;ve got an official kind of way of puttin&rsquo; these things clearly.
Will you just weigh in and give Miss Climpson the gist of that
rigmarole our friend served out to us last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pulling his wits into order, Mr. Parker accordingly obliged
with a digest of the doctor&rsquo;s story. Miss Climpson listened with
great attention, making notes of the dates and details. Parker
observed that she showed great acumen in seizing on the salient
points; she asked a number of very shrewd questions, and her
grey eyes were intelligent. When he had finished, she repeated
the story, and he was able to congratulate her on a clear head
and retentive memory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;A dear old friend of mine used to say that I should have
made a very good lawyer,&rdquo; said Miss Climpson, complacently,
&ldquo;but of course, when I was young, girls didn&rsquo;t have the education
or the <i>opportunities</i> they get nowadays, Mr. Parker. I
should have liked a good education, but my dear father didn&rsquo;t
believe in it for women. Very old-fashioned, you young people
would think him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Miss Climpson,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got
just exactly the qualifications we want, and they&rsquo;re rather rare,
so we&rsquo;re in luck. Now we want this matter pushed forward as
fast as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down to Somerset House at once,&rdquo; replied the lady,
with great energy, &ldquo;and let you know the minute I&rsquo;m ready to
start for Hampshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said his lordship, rising. &ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ll
just make a noise like a hoop and roll away. Oh! and while I
think of it, I&rsquo;d better give you something in hand for traveling
expenses and so on. I think you had better be just a retired
lady in easy circumstances looking for a nice little place to
settle down in. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d better be wealthy&mdash;wealthy
people don&rsquo;t inspire confidence. Perhaps you would oblige me
by living at the rate of about &pound;800 a year&mdash;your own excellent
taste and experience will suggest the correct accessories and so
on for creating that impression. If you will allow me, I will
give you a cheque for &pound;50 now, and when you start on your
wanderings you will let me know what you require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Miss Climpson, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a pure matter of business, of course,&rdquo; said Wimsey,
rather rapidly, &ldquo;and you will let me have a note of the expenses
in your usual business-like way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Miss Climpson was dignified. &ldquo;And I will
give you a proper receipt immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear,&rdquo; she added, hunting through her purse, &ldquo;I
do not appear to have any penny stamps. How extremely remiss
of me. It is most <i>unusual</i> for me not to have my little book of
stamps&mdash;so handy I always think they are&mdash;but only last night
Mrs. Williams borrowed my last stamps to send a very urgent
letter to her son in Japan. If you will excuse me a moment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have some,&rdquo; interposed Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you very much, Mr. Parker. Here is the twopence.
I <i>never</i> allow myself to be without pennies&mdash;on account
of the bathroom geyser, you know. Such a very <i>sensible</i> invention,
most <i>convenient</i>, and prevents <i>all</i> dispute about hot
water among the tenants. Thank you so much. And now I sign
my name <i>across</i> the stamps. That&rsquo;s right, isn&rsquo;t it? My dear father
would be surprised to find his daughter so business-like. He
always said a woman should never <i>need</i> to know anything about
money matters, but times have changed so greatly, have they
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Climpson ushered them down all six flights of stairs,
volubly protesting at their protests, and the door closed behind
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask&mdash;?&rdquo; began Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not what you think,&rdquo; said his lordship, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; agreed Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I knew you had a nasty mind. Even the closest
of one&rsquo;s friends turn out to be secret thinkers. They think in
private thoughts which they publicly repudiate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool. Who <i>is</i> Miss Climpson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Climpson,&rdquo; said Lord Peter, &ldquo;is a manifestation of
the wasteful way in which this country is run. Look at electricity.
Look at water-power. Look at the tides. Look at the sun.
Millions of power units being given off into space every minute.
Thousands of old maids, simply bursting with useful energy,
forced by our stupid social system into hydros and hotels and
communities and hostels and posts as companions, where their
magnificent gossip-powers and units of inquisitiveness are allowed
to dissipate themselves or even become harmful to the
community, while the ratepayers&rsquo; money is spent on getting
work for which these women are providentially fitted, inefficiently
carried out by ill-equipped policemen like you. My god!
it&rsquo;s enough to make a man write to <i>John Bull</i>. And then bright
young men write nasty little patronising books called &lsquo;Elderly
Women,&rsquo; and &lsquo;On the Edge of the Explosion&rsquo;&mdash;and the drunkards
make songs upon &rsquo;em, poor things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quite, quite,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;You mean that Miss Climpson
is a kind of inquiry agent for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is my ears and tongue,&rdquo; said Lord Peter, dramatically,
&ldquo;and especially my nose. She asks questions which a young
man could not put without a blush. She is the angel that rushes
in where fools get a clump on the head. She can smell a rat
in the dark. In fact, she is the cat&rsquo;s whiskers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a bad idea,&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally&mdash;it is mine, therefore brilliant. Just think. People
want questions asked. Whom do they send? A man with
large flat feet and a notebook&mdash;the sort of man whose private
life is conducted in a series of inarticulate grunts. I send a lady
with a long, woolly jumper on knitting-needles and jingly things
round her neck. Of course she asks questions&mdash;everyone expects
it. Nobody is surprised. Nobody is alarmed. And so-called
superfluity is agreeably and usefully disposed of. One of these
days you will put up a statue to me, with an inscription:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="sc">To the Man who Made
<br>Thousands of Superfluous Women
<br>Happy
<br>without Injury to their Modesty
<br>or Exertion to Himself.</span>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t talk so much,&rdquo; complained his friend.
&ldquo;And how about all those type-written reports? Are you turning
philanthropist in your old age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; said Wimsey, rather hurriedly hailing a taxi.
&ldquo;Tell you about that later. Little private pogrom of my own&mdash;Insurance
against the Socialist Revolution&mdash;when it comes.
&lsquo;What did you do with your great wealth, comrade?&rsquo; &lsquo;I bought
First Editions.&rsquo; &lsquo;Aristocrat! &agrave; la lanterne!&rsquo; &lsquo;Stay, spare me! I took
proceedings against 500 money-lenders who oppressed the
workers.&rsquo; &lsquo;Citizen, you have done well. We will spare your life.
You shall be promoted to cleaning out the sewers.&rsquo; Voil&agrave;! We
must move with the times. Citizen taxi-driver, take me to the
British Museum. Can I drop you anywhere? No? So long. I
am going to collate a 12th century manuscript of Tristan, while
the old order lasts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Mr. Parker thoughtfully boarded a westward-bound &rsquo;bus
and was rolled away to do some routine questioning, on his
own account, among the female population of Notting Dale.
It did not appear to him to be a milieu in which the talents of
Miss Climpson could be usefully employed.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Letter from Miss Alexandra Katherine Climpson to Lord Peter
Wimsey.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr">C/o Mrs. Hamilton Budge,</span>
<span class="jr">Fairview, Nelson Avenue,</span>
<span class="jr">Leahampton, Hants.</span>
<span class="jr">April 29th, 1927.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">My dear Lord Peter</span>,</p>
<p>You will be happy to hear, after my <i>two previous</i> bad shots
(!), that I have found the <i>right</i> place at last. The Agatha Dawson
certificate is the <i>correct</i> one, and the dreadful <i>scandal</i> about
Dr. Carr is still very much alive, I am sorry to say for the sake
of <i>human nature</i>. I have been fortunate enough to secure rooms
in the <i>very next street</i> to Wellington Avenue, where Miss Dawson
used to live. My landlady seems a very nice woman, though
a <i>terrible gossip</i>!&mdash;which is <i>all to the good</i>!! Her charge for a
very pleasant bedroom and sitting-room with <i>full board</i> is 3&frac12;
guineas weekly. I trust you will not think this <i>too extravagant</i>,
as the situation is <i>just</i> what you wished me to look for. I enclose
a careful statement of my expenses up-to-date. You will <i>excuse</i>
the mention of <i>underwear</i>, which is, I fear, a somewhat large
item! but wool is so expensive nowadays, and it is necessary
that every detail of my equipment should be suitable to my
(supposed!) position in life. I have been careful to <i>wash</i> the
garments through, so that they do not look <i>too new</i>, as this
might have a <i>suspicious</i> appearance!!</p>
<p>But you will be anxious for me to (if I may use a vulgar
expression) &lsquo;cut the cackle, and come to the horses&rsquo; (!!). On
the day after my arrival, I informed Mrs. Budge that I was a
great sufferer from <i>rheumatism</i> (which is quite true, as I have
a sad legacy of that kind left me by, alas! my <i>port-drinking</i>
ancestors!)&mdash;and inquired what <i>doctors</i> there were in the neighbourhood.
This at once brought forth a <i>long catalogue</i>, together
with a <i>grand panegyric</i> of the sandy soil and healthy situation
of the town. I said I should prefer an <i>elderly</i> doctor, as the
<i>young men</i>, in my opinion, were <i>not to be depended on</i>. Mrs.
Budge heartily agreed with me, and a little discreet questioning
brought out the <i>whole story</i> of Miss Dawson&rsquo;s illness and the
&lsquo;carryings-on&rsquo; (as she termed them) of Dr. Carr and <i>the nurse</i>!
&ldquo;I never did trust that first nurse,&rdquo; said Mrs. Budge, &ldquo;for all
she had her training at Guy&rsquo;s and ought to have been trustworthy.
A sly, red-headed, <i>baggage</i>, and it&rsquo;s my belief that all
Dr. Carr&rsquo;s fussing over Miss Dawson and his visits all day and
every day were just to get love-making with Nurse Philliter.
No wonder poor Miss Whittaker couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer
and gave the girl the sack&mdash;none too soon, in my opinion.
Not quite so attentive after that, Dr. Carr wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;why, up to
the last minute, he was pretending the old lady was quite all
right, when Miss Whittaker had only said the day before that
she felt sure she was going to be taken from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked if Mrs. Budge knew Miss Whittaker personally.
Miss Whittaker is <i>the niece</i>, you know.</p>
<p>Not personally, she said, though she had met her in a
social way at the Vicarage working-parties. But she knew all
about it, because her maid was own sister to the maid at Miss
Dawson&rsquo;s. Now is not that a <i>fortunate</i> coincidence, for you
know how these girls <i>talk</i>!</p>
<p>I also made careful inquiries about the <i>Vicar</i>, Mr. Tredgold,
and was much gratified to find that he teaches <i>sound
Catholic</i> doctrine, so that I shall be able to attend the Church
(S. Onesimus) without doing <i>violence</i> to my religious beliefs&mdash;a
thing I could <i>not</i> undertake to do, <i>even in your interests</i>. I
am sure you will <i>understand</i> this. As it happens, <i>all is well</i>,
and I have written to my <i>very good friend</i>, the Vicar of S.
Edfrith&rsquo;s, Holborn, to ask for an introduction to Mr. Tredgold.
By this means, I feel sure of meeting <i>Miss Whittaker</i> before
long, as I hear she is quite a &ldquo;pillar of the Church&rdquo;! I do hope
it is not wrong to make use of the Church of God to a <i>worldly</i>
end; but after all, you are only seeking to establish <i>Truth</i> and
<i>Justice</i>!&mdash;and in so good a cause, we may <i>perhaps</i> permit ourselves
to be a little bit <i>JESUITICAL</i>!!!</p>
<p>This is all I have been able to do as yet, but I shall not
be <i>idle</i>, and will write to you again as soon as I have <i>anything
to report</i>. By the way, the <i>pillar-box</i> is most <i>conveniently</i> placed
just at the corner of Wellington Avenue, so that I can easily
<i>run out</i> and post my letters to you <i>myself</i> (away from <i>prying</i>
eyes!!)&mdash;and just take a little peep at Miss <i>Dawson&rsquo;s</i>&mdash;now Miss
<i>Whittaker&rsquo;s</i>&mdash;house, &ldquo;The Grove,&rdquo; at the same time.</p>
<p><span class="center">Believe me,</span>
<span class="center"><span class="hst">Sincerely yours,</span></span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">Alexandra Katherine Climpson</span>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The little red-headed nurse gave her visitor a quick, slightly
hostile look-over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite all right,&rdquo; he said apologetically, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t come
to sell you soap or gramophones, or to borrow money or enroll
you in the Ancient Froth-blowers or anything charitable. I
really am Lord Peter Wimsey&mdash;I mean, that really is my title,
don&rsquo;t you know, not a Christian name like Sanger&rsquo;s Circus or
Earl Derr Biggers. I&rsquo;ve come to ask you some questions, and
I&rsquo;ve no real excuse, I&rsquo;m afraid, for butting in on you&mdash;do you
ever read the <i>News of the World</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nurse Philliter decided that she was to be asked to go to
a mental case, and that the patient had come to fetch her in
person.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; she said, guardedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;well, you may have noticed my name croppin&rsquo; up
in a few murders and things lately. I sleuth, you know. For a
hobby. Harmless outlet for natural inquisitiveness, don&rsquo;t you
see, which might otherwise strike inward and produce introspection
an&rsquo; suicide. Very natural, healthy pursuit&mdash;not too
strenuous, not too sedentary; trains and invigorates the mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know who you are now,&rdquo; said Nurse Philliter, slowly.
&ldquo;You&mdash;you gave evidence against Sir Julian Freke. In fact, you
traced the murder to him, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did&mdash;it was rather unpleasant,&rdquo; said Lord Peter, simply,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got another little job of the same kind in hand now,
and I want your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo; said Nurse Philliter, setting the
example. &ldquo;How am I concerned in the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Dr. Edward Carr, I think&mdash;late of Leahampton&mdash;conscientious
but a little lackin&rsquo; in worldly wisdom&mdash;not
serpentine at all, as the Bible advises, but far otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;do <i>you</i> believe it was murder, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter looked at her for a few seconds. Her face was
eager, her eyes gleaming curiously under her thick, level brows.
She had expressive hands, rather large and with strong, flat
joints. He noticed how they gripped the arms of her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t the faintest,&rdquo; he replied, nonchalantly, &ldquo;but I
wanted your opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine?&rdquo;&mdash;she checked herself. &ldquo;You know, I am not supposed
to give opinions about my cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have given it to me already,&rdquo; said his lordship, grinning.
&ldquo;Though possibly I ought to allow for a little prejudice
in favour of Dr. Carr&rsquo;s diagnosis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not merely personal. I mean, my being
engaged to Dr. Carr wouldn&rsquo;t affect my judgment of a cancer
case. I have worked with him on a great many of them, and
I know that his opinion is really trustworthy&mdash;just as I know
that, as a motorist, he&rsquo;s exactly the opposite.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right. I take it that if he says the death was inexplicable,
it really was so. That&rsquo;s one point gained. Now about the old
lady herself. I gather she was a little queer towards the end&mdash;a
bit mental, I think you people call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;d say that either. Of course, when she
was under morphia, she would be unconscious, or only semi-conscious,
for hours together. But up to the time when I left,
I should say she was quite&mdash;well, quite all there. She was
obstinate, you know, and what they call a character, at the best
of times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dr. Carr told me she got odd fancies&mdash;about people
poisoning her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red-haired nurse rubbed her fingers slowly along the
arm of the chair, and hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it will make you feel any less unprofessional,&rdquo; said Lord
Peter, guessing what was in her mind, &ldquo;I may say that my friend
Detective-Inspector Parker is looking into this matter with me,
which gives me a sort of right to ask questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case&mdash;yes&mdash;in that case I think I can speak freely.
I never understood about that poisoning idea. I never saw
anything of it&mdash;no aversion, I mean, or fear of me. As a rule,
a patient will show it, if she&rsquo;s got any queer ideas about the
nurse. Poor Miss Dawson was always most kind and affectionate.
She kissed me when I went away and gave me a little
present, and said she was sorry to lose me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t show any sort of nervousness about taking food
from you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to give her any food that last week.
Miss Whittaker said her aunt had taken this funny notion, and
gave her all her meals herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s very interestin&rsquo;. Was it Miss Whittaker, then,
who first mentioned this little eccentricity to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And she begged me not to say anything about it to
Miss Dawson, for fear of agitating her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not. I wouldn&rsquo;t mention it in any case to a patient.
It does no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Miss Dawson ever speak about it to anyone else? Dr.
Carr, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. According to Miss Whittaker, her aunt was frightened
of the doctor too, because she imagined he was in league with
me. Of course, that story rather lent colour to the unkind things
that were said afterwards. I suppose it&rsquo;s just possible that she
saw us glancing at one another or speaking aside, and got the
idea that we were plotting something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the maids?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were new maids about that time. She probably
wouldn&rsquo;t talk about it to them, and anyhow, I wouldn&rsquo;t be
discussing my patient with her servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Why did the other maids leave? How many
were there? Did they all go at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of them went. They were sisters. One was a terrible
crockery-smasher, and Miss Whittaker gave her notice, so the
other left with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well! one can have too much of seeing the Crown
Derby rollin&rsquo; round the floor. Quite. Then it had nothing to
do with&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t on account of any little&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t because they couldn&rsquo;t get along with the nurse,
if you mean that,&rdquo; said Nurse Philliter, with a smile. &ldquo;They
were very obliging girls, but not very bright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite. Well, now, is there any little odd, out-of-the-way
incident you can think of that might throw light on the thing.
There was a visit from a lawyer, I believe, that agitated your
patient quite a lot. Was that in your time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I only heard about it from Dr. Carr. And he never
heard the name of the lawyer, what he came about, or anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pity,&rdquo; said his lordship. &ldquo;I have been hoping great things
of the lawyer. There&rsquo;s such a sinister charm, don&rsquo;t you think,
about lawyers who appear unexpectedly with little bags, and
alarm people with mysterious conferences, and then go away
leaving urgent messages that if anything happens they are to
be sent for. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the lawyer, I probably shouldn&rsquo;t
have treated Dr. Carr&rsquo;s medical problem with the respect it
deserves. He never came again, or wrote, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Wait a minute. I do remember one thing.
I remember Miss Dawson having another hysterical attack of
the same sort, and saying just what she said then&mdash;&lsquo;that they
were trying to kill her before her time.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a couple of weeks before I left. Miss Whittaker had
been up to her with the post, I think, and there were some
papers of some kind to sign, and it seems to have upset her. I
came in from my walk and found her in a dreadful state. The
maids could have told you more about it than I could, really,
for they were doing some dusting on the landing at the time
and heard her going on, and they ran down and fetched me
up to her. I didn&rsquo;t ask them about what happened myself,
naturally&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t do for nurses to gossip with the maids
behind their employers&rsquo; backs. Miss Whittaker said that her
aunt had had an annoying communication from a solicitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it sounds as though there might be something there.
Do you remember what the maids were called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the name now? A funny one, or I shouldn&rsquo;t
remember it&mdash;Gotobed, that was it&mdash;Bertha and Evelyn Gotobed.
I don&rsquo;t know where they went, but I daresay you could
find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now one last question, and I want you to forget all about
Christian kindliness and the law of slander when you answer
it. What is Miss Whittaker like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An indefinable expression crossed the nurse&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tall, handsome, very decided in manner,&rdquo; she said, with
an air of doing strict justice against her will, &ldquo;an extremely
competent nurse&mdash;she was at the Royal Free, you know, till
she went to live with her aunt. I think she would have made
a perfectly wonderful theatre nurse. She did not like me, nor
I her, you know, Lord Peter&mdash;and it&rsquo;s better I should be telling
you so at once, that way you can take everything I say about
her with a grain of charity added&mdash;but we both knew good
hospital work when we saw it, and respected one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why in the world didn&rsquo;t she like you, Miss Philliter? I
really don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ve seen a more likeable kind of person,
if you&rsquo;ll &rsquo;scuse my mentionin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The nurse seemed a little embarrassed.
&ldquo;The dislike seemed to grow on her. You&mdash;perhaps you heard
the kind of things people said in the town? when I left?&mdash;that
Dr. Carr and I&mdash;Oh! it really was damnable, and I had the
most dreadful interview with Matron when I got back here.
She <i>must</i> have spread those stories. Who else could have done
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;you <i>did</i> become engaged to Dr. Carr, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
said his lordship, gently. &ldquo;Mind you, I&rsquo;m not sayin&rsquo; it wasn&rsquo;t
a very agreeable occurrence and all that, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she said I neglected the patient. I <i>never</i> did. I wouldn&rsquo;t
think of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. No. But, do you suppose that possibly
getting engaged was an offence in itself? Is Miss Whittaker
engaged to anyone, by the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You mean, was she jealous? I&rsquo;m sure Dr. Carr never
gave the slightest, not the <i>slightest</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>please</i>,&rdquo; cried Lord Peter, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t be ruffled.
Such a nice word, ruffled&mdash;like a kitten, I always think&mdash;so
furry and nice. But even without the least what-d&rsquo;ye-call-it on
Dr. Carr&rsquo;s side, he&rsquo;s a very prepossessin&rsquo; person and all that.
Don&rsquo;t you think there <i>might</i> be something in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did think so once,&rdquo; admitted Miss Philliter, &ldquo;but afterwards,
when she got him into such awful trouble over the post-mortem,
I gave up the idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t object to the post-mortem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did not. But there&rsquo;s such a thing as putting yourself
in the right in the eyes of your neighbours, Lord Peter, and
then going off to tell people all about it at Vicarage tea-parties.
I wasn&rsquo;t there, but you ask someone who was. I know those
tea-parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not impossible. People can be very spiteful if
they think they&rsquo;ve been slighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Nurse Philliter, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added suddenly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s no motive for murdering a
perfectly innocent old lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the second time you&rsquo;ve used that word,&rdquo; said Wimsey,
gravely. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no proof yet that it was murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you think it was?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think she did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter walked across to the aspidistra in the bow-window
and stroked its leaves thoughtfully. The silence was
broken by a buxom nurse who, entering precipitately first and
knocking afterwards, announced with a giggle:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, I&rsquo;m sure, but you&rsquo;re in request this afternoon,
Philliter. Here&rsquo;s Dr. Carr come for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Carr followed hard upon his name. The sight of Wimsey
struck him speechless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;d be turnin&rsquo; up again before long,&rdquo; said Lord
Peter, cheerfully. &ldquo;Sherlock is my name and Holmes is my
nature. I&rsquo;m delighted to see you, Dr. Carr. Your little matter
is well in hand, and seein&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not required any longer I&rsquo;ll
make a noise like a bee and buzz off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did <i>he</i> get here?&rdquo; demanded Dr. Carr, not altogether
pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you send him? I think he&rsquo;s very nice,&rdquo; said Nurse
Philliter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; said Dr. Carr.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s clever,&rdquo; said the red-haired nurse.</p>

<p class="lr">Butler, <i>Hudibras</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;So you are thinking of coming to live in Leahampton,&rdquo; said
Miss Murgatroyd. &ldquo;How <i>very nice</i>. I do hope you will be settling
down in the parish. We are <i>not</i> too well off for week-day
congregations&mdash;there is so much indifference and so much
<i>Protestantism</i> about. There! I have dropped a stitch. Provoking!
Perhaps it was meant as a little reminder to me not to think
uncharitably about Protestants. All is well&mdash;I have retrieved
it. Were you thinking of taking a house, Miss Climpson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not quite sure,&rdquo; replied Miss Climpson. &ldquo;Rents are
so very high nowadays, and I fear that to buy a house would
be almost beyond my means. I must look round very carefully,
and view the question from <i>all sides</i>. I should certainly <i>prefer</i>
to be in this parish&mdash;and close to the Church, if possible.
Perhaps the Vicar would know whether there is likely to be
anything suitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, he would doubtless be able to suggest something.
It is such a very nice, residential neighbourhood. I am sure
you would like it. Let me see&mdash;you are staying in Nelson
Avenue, I think Mrs. Tredgold said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;with Mrs. Budge at Fairview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure she makes you comfortable. Such a nice woman,
though I&rsquo;m afraid she never stops talking. Hasn&rsquo;t she got any
ideas on the subject? I&rsquo;m sure if there&rsquo;s any news going about,
Mrs. Budge never fails to get hold of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Climpson, seizing the opening with a
swiftness which would have done credit to Napoleon, &ldquo;she did
say something about a house in Wellington Avenue which she
thought might be to let before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wellington Avenue? You surprise me! I thought I knew
almost everybody there. Could it be the Parfitts&mdash;really moving
at last! They have been talking about it for at least seven years,
and I really had begun to think it was <i>all talk</i>. Mrs. Peasgood,
do you hear that? Miss Climpson says the Parfitts are really
leaving that house at last!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Peasgood, raising her rather prominent
eyes from a piece of plain needlework and focusing them
on Miss Climpson like a pair of opera-glasses. &ldquo;Well, that <i>is</i>
news. It must be that brother of hers who was staying with
them last week. Possibly he is going to live with them permanently,
and that would clinch the matter, of course, for they
couldn&rsquo;t get on without another bedroom when the girls come
home from school. A very sensible arrangement, I should think.
I believe he is quite well off, you know, and it will be a very
good thing for those children. I wonder where they will go. I
expect it will be one of the new houses out on the Winchester
Road, though of course that would mean keeping a car. Still,
I expect he would want them to do that in any case. Most
likely he will have it himself, and let them have the use of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Parfitt was the name,&rdquo; broke in Miss Climpson
hurriedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t. It was a Miss somebody&mdash;a
Miss Whittaker, I think, Mrs. Budge mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Whittaker?&rdquo; cried both the ladies in chorus. &ldquo;Oh,
no! <i>surely</i> not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Miss Whittaker would have told me if she thought
of giving up her house,&rdquo; pursued Miss Murgatroyd. &ldquo;We are
such great friends. I think Mrs. Budge must have run away
with a wrong idea. People do build up such amazing stories
out of nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as that,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Peasgood, rebukingly.
&ldquo;There <i>may</i> be something in it. I know dear Miss
Whittaker has sometimes spoken to me about wishing to take
up chicken-farming. I daresay she has not mentioned the matter
<i>generally</i>, but then she always confides in <i>me</i>. Depend on it,
that is what she intends to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Budge didn&rsquo;t actually say Miss Whittaker was moving,&rdquo;
interposed Miss Climpson. &ldquo;She said, I think, that Miss
Whittaker had been left alone by some relation&rsquo;s death, and
she wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she found the house lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s Mrs. Budge all over!&rdquo; said Mrs. Peasgood, nodding
ominously. &ldquo;A most excellent woman, but she sometimes
gets hold of the wrong end of the stick. Not but what I&rsquo;ve often
thought the same thing myself. I said to poor Mary Whittaker
only the other day, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you find it very lonely in that house,
my dear, now that your poor dear Aunt is no more?&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sure
it would be a very good thing if she did move, or got someone
to live with her. It&rsquo;s not a natural life for a young woman, all
alone like that, and so I told her. I&rsquo;m one of those that believe
in speaking their mind, you know, Miss Climpson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, so am I, Mrs. Peasgood,&rdquo; rejoined Miss
Climpson promptly, &ldquo;and that is what I said to Mrs. Budge at
the time. I said, &lsquo;Do I understand that there was anything <i>odd</i>
about the old lady&rsquo;s death?&rsquo;&mdash;because she had spoken of the
<i>peculiar circumstances</i> of the case, and you know, I should not
<i>at all like</i> to live in a house which could be called in any way
<i>notorious</i>. I should really feel quite <i>uncomfortable</i> about it.&rdquo;
In saying which, Miss Climpson no doubt spoke with perfect
sincerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not at all&mdash;not at all,&rdquo; cried Miss Murgatroyd, so
eagerly that Mrs. Peasgood, who had paused to purse up her
face and assume an expression of portentous secrecy before
replying, was completely crowded out and left at the post.
&ldquo;There never was a more wicked story. The death was natural&mdash;perfectly
natural, and a most happy release, poor soul, I&rsquo;m
sure, for her sufferings at the last were truly terrible. It was all
a scandalous story put about by that young Dr. Carr (whom
I&rsquo;m sure I never liked) simply to aggrandise himself. As though
any doctor would pronounce so definitely upon what exact date
it would please God to call a poor sufferer to Himself! Human
pride and vanity make a most shocking exhibition, Miss Climpson,
when they lead us to cast suspicion on innocent people,
simply because we are wedded to our own presumptuous opinions.
Poor Miss Whittaker! She went through a most terrible
time. But it was proved&mdash;absolutely <i>proved</i>, that there was
nothing in the story at all, and I hope that young man was
properly ashamed of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be two opinions about that, Miss Murgatroyd,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Peasgood. &ldquo;I say what I think, Miss Climpson,
and in my opinion there should have been an inquest. I try
to be up-to-date, and I believe Dr. Carr to have been a very
able young man, though of course, he was not the kind of old-fashioned
family doctor that appeals to elderly people. It was
a great pity that nice Nurse Philliter was sent away&mdash;that woman
Forbes was no more use than a headache&mdash;to use my brother&rsquo;s
rather vigorous expression. I don&rsquo;t think she knew her job, and
that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nurse Forbes was a charming person,&rdquo; snapped Miss
Murgatroyd, pink with indignation at being called elderly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Peasgood, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t
get over the fact that she nearly killed herself one day by taking
nine grains of calomel by mistake for three. She told me that
herself, and what she did in one case she might do in another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Miss Dawson wasn&rsquo;t given anything,&rdquo; said Miss Murgatroyd,
&ldquo;and at any rate, Nurse Forbes&rsquo; mind was on her
patient, and not on flirting with the doctor. I&rsquo;ve always thought
that Dr. Carr felt a spite against her for taking his young woman&rsquo;s
place, and nothing would have pleased him better than to
get her into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean,&rdquo; said Miss Climpson, &ldquo;that he would
refuse a certificate and cause all that trouble, just to annoy the
nurse. <i>Surely</i> no doctor would dare to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Mrs. Peasgood, &ldquo;and nobody with a
grain of sense would suppose it for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much, Mrs. Peasgood,&rdquo; cried Miss Murgatroyd,
&ldquo;thank you very much, I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say what I think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Peasgood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m glad I haven&rsquo;t such uncharitable thoughts,&rdquo;
said Miss Murgatroyd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think your own observations are so remarkable for
their charity,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Peasgood.</p>
<p>Fortunately, at this moment Miss Murgatroyd, in her agitation,
gave a vicious tweak to the wrong needle and dropped
twenty-nine stitches at once. The Vicar&rsquo;s wife, scenting battle
from afar, hurried over with a plate of scones, and helped to
bring about a diversion. To her, Miss Climpson, doggedly sticking
to her mission in life, broached the subject of the house
in Wellington Avenue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Tredgold,
&ldquo;but there&rsquo;s Miss Whittaker just arrived. Come over to my
corner and I&rsquo;ll introduce her to you, and you can have a nice
chat about it. You will like each other so much, she is such a
keen worker. Oh! and Mrs. Peasgood, my husband is so anxious
to have a word with you about the choirboys&rsquo; social. He is
discussing it now with Mrs. Findlater. I wonder if you&rsquo;d be so
very good as to come and give him your opinion? He values
it so much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Thus tactfully the good lady parted the disputants and,
having deposited Mrs. Peasgood safely under the clerical wing,
towed Miss Climpson away to an arm-chair near the tea-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Miss Whittaker, I so want you to know Miss Climpson.
She is a near neighbour of yours&mdash;in Nelson Avenue,
and I hope we shall persuade her to make her home among
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be delightful,&rdquo; said Miss Whittaker.</p>
<p>The first impression which Miss Climpson got of Mary
Whittaker was that she was totally out of place among the tea-tables
of S. Onesimus. With her handsome, strongly-marked
features and quiet air of authority, she was of the type that
&ldquo;does well&rdquo; in City offices. She had a pleasant and self-possessed
manner, and was beautifully tailored&mdash;not mannishly, and yet
with a severe fineness of outline that negatived the appeal of
a beautiful figure. With her long and melancholy experience
of frustrated womanhood, observed in a dreary succession of
cheap boarding-houses, Miss Climpson was able to dismiss one
theory which had vaguely formed itself in her mind. This was
no passionate nature, cramped by association with an old woman
and eager to be free to mate before youth should depart. <i>That</i>
look she knew well&mdash;she could diagnose it with dreadful accuracy
at the first glance, in the tone of a voice saying, &ldquo;How
do you do?&rdquo; But meeting Mary Whittaker&rsquo;s clear, light eyes
under their well-shaped brows, she was struck by a sudden
sense of familiarity. She had seen that look before, though the
where and the when escaped her. Chatting volubly about her
arrival in Leahampton, her introduction to the Vicar and her
approval of the Hampshire air and sandy soil, Miss Climpson
racked her shrewd brain for a clue. But the memory remained
obstinately somewhere at the back of her head. &ldquo;It will come
to me in the night,&rdquo; thought Miss Climpson, confidently, &ldquo;and
meanwhile I won&rsquo;t say anything about the house; it would seem
so pushing on a first acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon, fate instantly intervened to overthrow this
prudent resolve, and very nearly ruined the whole effect of
Miss Climpson&rsquo;s diplomacy at one fell swoop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>The form which the avenging Erinyes assumed was that
of the youngest Miss Findlater&mdash;the gushing one&mdash;who came
romping over to them, her hands filled with baby-linen, and
plumped down on the end of the sofa beside Miss Whittaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary my <i>dear</i>! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me? You really are
going to start your chicken-farming scheme at once. I&rsquo;d no
<i>idea</i> you&rsquo;d got on so far with your plans. How <i>could</i> you let
me hear it first from somebody else? You promised to tell me
before anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t know it myself,&rdquo; replied Miss Whittaker,
coolly. &ldquo;Who told you this wonderful story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Peasgood said that she heard it from&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo; Here
Miss Findlater was in a difficulty. She had not yet been introduced
to Miss Climpson and hardly knew how to refer to her
before her face. &ldquo;This lady&rdquo; was what a shop-girl would say;
&ldquo;Miss Climpson&rdquo; would hardly do, as she had, so to speak, no
official cognisance of the name; &ldquo;Mrs. Budge&rsquo;s new lodger&rdquo; was
obviously impossible in the circumstances. She hesitated&mdash;then
beamed a bright appeal at Miss Climpson, and said: &ldquo;Our
new helper&mdash;may I introduce myself? I do <i>so</i> detest formality,
don&rsquo;t you, and to belong to the Vicarage work-party is a sort
of introduction in itself, don&rsquo;t you think? Miss Climpson, I
believe? How do you do? It is true, isn&rsquo;t it, Mary?&mdash;that you
are letting your house to Miss Climpson, and starting a poultry-farm
at Alford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not that I know of. Miss Climpson and I have
only just met one another.&rdquo; The tone of Miss Whittaker&rsquo;s voice
suggested that the first meeting might very willingly be the last
so far as she was concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; cried the youngest Miss Findlater, who was
fair and bobbed and rather coltish, &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve dropped a
brick. I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> Mrs. Peasgood understood that it was all settled.&rdquo;
She appealed to Miss Climpson again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quite</i> a mistake!&rdquo; said that lady, energetically, &ldquo;what <i>must</i>
you be thinking of me, Miss Whittaker? <i>Of course</i>, I could not
<i>possibly</i> have said such a thing. I only happened to mention&mdash;in
the most <i>casual</i> way, that I was looking&mdash;that is, <i>thinking</i>
of looking about&mdash;for a house in the neighbourhood of the
Church&mdash;so convenient, you know, for <i>Early Services</i> and
<i>Saints&rsquo; Days</i>&mdash;and it was suggested&mdash;just <i>suggested</i>, I really
forget by <i>whom</i>, that you <i>might</i>, just <i>possibly</i>, at <i>some</i> time,
consider letting your house. I assure you, that was <i>all</i>.&rdquo; In
saying which, Miss Climpson was not wholly accurate or disingenuous,
but excused herself to her conscience on the rather
jesuitical grounds that where so much responsibility was floating
about, it was best to pin it down in the quarter which made
for peace. &ldquo;Miss Murgatroyd,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;put me right at
once, for she said you were <i>certainly</i> not thinking of any such
thing, or you would have told her before anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Whittaker laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I should have told my house-agent.
It&rsquo;s quite true, I did have it in mind, but I certainly
haven&rsquo;t taken any steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really are thinking of doing it, then?&rdquo; cried Miss
Findlater. &ldquo;I do hope so&mdash;because, if you do, I mean to apply
for a job on the farm! I&rsquo;m simply longing to get away from all
these silly tennis-parties and things, and live close to the Earth
and the fundamental crudities. Do you read Sheila Kaye-Smith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Climpson said no, but she was very fond of Thomas
Hardy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really is terrible, living in a little town like this,&rdquo; went
on Miss Findlater, &ldquo;so full of aspidistras, you know, and small
gossip. You&rsquo;ve no idea what a dreadfully gossipy place Leahampton
is, Miss Climpson. I&rsquo;m sure, Mary dear, you must
have had more than enough of it, with that tiresome Dr. Carr
and the things people said. I don&rsquo;t wonder you&rsquo;re thinking of
getting rid of that house. I shouldn&rsquo;t think you could ever feel
comfortable in it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why on earth not?&rdquo; said Miss Whittaker, lightly. Too
lightly? Miss Climpson was startled to recognise in eye and
voice the curious quick defensiveness of the neglected spinster
who cries out that she has no use for men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; said Miss Findlater, &ldquo;I always think it&rsquo;s a little
sad, living where people have died, you know. Dear Miss Dawson&mdash;though
of course it really was merciful that she should
be released&mdash;all the same&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Evidently, thought Miss Climpson, she was turning the
matter off. The atmosphere of suspicion surrounding the death
had been in her mind, but she shied at referring to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are very few houses in which somebody hasn&rsquo;t died
sometime or other,&rdquo; said Miss Whittaker. &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t see
why people should worry about it. I suppose it&rsquo;s just a question
of not realising. We are not sensitive to the past lives of people
we don&rsquo;t know. Just as we are much less upset about epidemics
and accidents that happen a long way off. Do you really suppose,
by the way, Miss Climpson, that this Chinese business
is coming to anything? Everybody seems to take it very casually.
If all this rioting and Bolshevism was happening in Hyde Park,
there&rsquo;d be a lot more fuss made about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Climpson made a suitable reply. That night she wrote
to Lord Peter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Miss Whittaker has asked me to tea. She tells me that,
<i>much as she would enjoy</i> an active, country life, with something
definite to do, she has a <i>deep affection</i> for the house in Wellington
Avenue, and <i>cannot tear herself away</i>. She seems <i>very
anxious</i> to give this impression. Would it be <i>fair</i> for me to say
&ldquo;The lady doth protest <i>too much</i>, methinks&rdquo;? The <i>Prince of
Denmark</i> might even add: &ldquo;Let the galled jade wince&rdquo;&mdash;if one
can use that expression of a <i>lady</i>. How wonderful Shakespeare
is! One can <i>always</i> find a phrase in his works for <i>any</i> situation!</p>

<p class="tb">&ldquo;You know, Wimsey, I think you&rsquo;ve found a mare&rsquo;s nest,&rdquo; objected
Mr. Parker. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s the slightest reason
for supposing that there was anything odd about the Dawson
woman&rsquo;s death. You&rsquo;ve nothing to go on but a conceited young
doctor&rsquo;s opinion and a lot of silly gossip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got an official mind, Charles,&rdquo; replied his friend.
&ldquo;Your official passion for evidence is gradually sapping your
brilliant intellect and smothering your instincts. You&rsquo;re over-civilised,
that&rsquo;s your trouble. Compared with you, I am a child
of nature. I dwell among the untrodden ways beside the springs
of Dove, a maid whom there are (I am shocked to say) few to
praise, likewise very few to love, which is perhaps just as well.
I <i>know</i> there is something wrong about this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&mdash;well, just as I know there is something wrong
about that case of reputed Lafite &rsquo;76 which that infernal fellow
Pettigrew-Robinson had the nerve to try out on me the other
night. It has a nasty flavour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flavour be damned. There&rsquo;s no indication of violence or
poison. There&rsquo;s no motive for doing away with the old girl.
And there&rsquo;s no possibility of proving anything against anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter selected a Villar y Villar from his case, and
lighted it with artistic care.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you take a bet about it? I&rsquo;ll lay
you ten to one that Agatha Dawson was murdered, twenty to
one that Mary Whittaker did it, and fifty to one that I bring it
home to her within the year. Are you on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a poor man, your Majesty,&rdquo; he temporised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; said Lord Peter, triumphantly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
not comfortable about it yourself. If you were, you&rsquo;d have said,
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s taking your money, old chap,&rsquo; and closed like a shot, in
the happy assurance of a certainty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen enough to know that nothing is a certainty,&rdquo;
retorted the detective, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll take you&mdash;in&mdash;half-crowns,&rdquo;
he added, cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you said ponies,&rdquo; replied Lord Peter, &ldquo;I would have
taken your alleged poverty into consideration and spared you,
but seven-and-sixpence will neither make nor break you. Consequently,
I shall proceed to make my statements good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what step do you propose taking?&rdquo; inquired Parker,
sarcastically. &ldquo;Shall you apply for an exhumation order and
search for poison, regardless of the analyst&rsquo;s report? Or kidnap
Miss Whittaker and apply the third-degree in the Gallic manner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. I am more modern. I shall use up-to-date
psychological methods. Like the people in the Psalms, I lay
traps; I catch men. I shall let the alleged criminal convict
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on! You are a one, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Parker, jeeringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am indeed. It is a well-established psychological fact
that criminals cannot let well alone. They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revisit the place of the crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt, blast you. They take unnecessary steps
to cover the traces which they haven&rsquo;t left, and so invite, seriatim,
Suspicion, Inquiry, Proof, Conviction and the Gallows.
Eminent legal writers&mdash;no, pax! don&rsquo;t chuck that S. Augustine
about, it&rsquo;s valuable. Anyhow, not to cast the jewels of my
eloquence into the pig-bucket, I propose to insert this advertisement
in all the morning papers. Miss Whittaker must read
<i>some</i> product of our brilliant journalistic age, I suppose. By
this means, we shall kill two birds with one stone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Start two hares at once, you mean,&rdquo; grumbled Parker.
&ldquo;Hand it over.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Bertha and Evelyn Gotobed</span>, formerly in
the service of Miss Agatha Dawson, of &lsquo;The Grove,&rsquo;
Wellington Avenue, Leahampton, are requested to
communicate with J. Murbles, solicitor, of Staple
Inn, when they will hear of <span class="small">SOMETHING TO THEIR
ADVANTAGE</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Rather good, I think, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;Calculated
to rouse suspicion in the most innocent mind. I bet
you Mary Whittaker will fall for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so interesting. I hope nothing
unpleasant will happen to dear old Murbles. I should hate to
lose him. He&rsquo;s such a perfect type of the family solicitor. Still,
a man in his profession must be prepared to take risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bosh!&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;But I agree that it might be as
well to get hold of the girls, if you really want to find out about
the Dawson household. Servants always know everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t only that. Don&rsquo;t you remember that Nurse Philliter
said the girls were sacked shortly before she left herself? Now,
passing over the odd circumstances of the Nurse&rsquo;s own dismissal&mdash;the
story about Miss Dawson&rsquo;s refusing to take food
from her hands, which wasn&rsquo;t at all borne out by the old lady&rsquo;s
own attitude to her nurse&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it worth considerin&rsquo; that these
girls should have been pushed off on some excuse just about
three weeks after one of those hysterical attacks of Miss Dawson&rsquo;s?
Doesn&rsquo;t it rather look as though everybody who was likely
to remember anything about that particular episode had been
got out of the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there was a good reason for getting rid of the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Crockery?&mdash;well, nowadays it&rsquo;s not so easy to get good
servants. Mistresses put up with a deal more carelessness than
they did in the dear dead days beyond recall. Then, about that
attack. Why did Miss Whittaker choose just the very moment
when the highly-intelligent Nurse Philliter had gone for her
walk, to bother Miss Dawson about signin&rsquo; some tiresome old
lease or other? If business was liable to upset the old girl, why
not have a capable person at hand to calm her down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Miss Whittaker is a trained nurse. She was surely
capable enough to see to her aunt herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly sure she was a very capable woman indeed,&rdquo;
said Wimsey, with emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right. You&rsquo;re prejudiced. But stick the ad. in by
all means. It can&rsquo;t do any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter paused, in the very act of ringing the bell. His
jaw slackened, giving his long, narrow face a faintly foolish
and hesitant look, reminiscent of the heroes of Mr. P. G. Wodehouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Oh! rats!&rdquo; He pressed the
button. &ldquo;It <i>can&rsquo;t</i> do any harm, as you say. Bunter, see that this
advertisement appears in the personal columns of all this list
of papers, every day until further notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The advertisement made its first appearance on the Tuesday
morning. Nothing of any note happened during the week,
except that Miss Climpson wrote in some distress to say that
the youngest Miss Findlater had at length succeeded in persuading
Miss Whittaker to take definite steps about the poultry
farm. They had gone away together to look at a business which
they had seen advertised in the <i>Poultry News</i>, and proposed to
be away for some weeks. Miss Climpson feared that under the
circumstances she would not be able to carry on any investigations
of sufficient importance to justify her <i>far too generous</i>
salary. She had, however, become friendly with Miss Findlater,
who had promised to tell her <i>all about</i> their doings. Lord Peter
replied in reassuring terms.</p>
<p>On the Tuesday following, Mr. Parker was just wrestling
in prayer with his charlady, who had a tiresome habit of boiling
his breakfast kippers till they resembled heavily pickled loofahs,
when the telephone whirred aggressively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Charles?&rdquo; asked Lord Peter&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I say,
Murbles has had a letter about that girl, Bertha Gotobed. She
disappeared from her lodgings last Thursday, and her landlady,
getting anxious, and having seen the advertisement, is coming
to tell us all she knows. Can you come round to Staple Inn at
eleven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; said Parker, a little irritably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a job to
see to. Surely you can tackle it by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; The voice was peevish. &ldquo;But I thought you&rsquo;d
like to have some of the fun. What an ungrateful devil you
are. You aren&rsquo;t taking the faintest interest in this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe in it, you know. All right&mdash;don&rsquo;t
use language like that&mdash;you&rsquo;ll frighten the girl at the Exchange.
I&rsquo;ll see what I can do. Eleven?&mdash;right!&mdash;Oh, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cluck!&rdquo; said the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rung off,&rdquo; said Parker, bitterly. &ldquo;Bertha Gotobed. H&rsquo;m!
I could have sworn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached across to the breakfast-table for the <i>Daily Yell</i>,
which was propped against the marmalade jar, and read with
pursed lips a paragraph whose heavily leaded headlines had
caught his eye, just before the interruption of the kipper
episode.</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;NIPPY&rdquo; FOUND DEAD
<br>IN EPPING FOREST
<br>&mdash;
<br>&pound;5 <span class="sc">Note in Hand-bag</span>.
<br>&mdash;</p>
<p>He took up the receiver again and asked for Wimsey&rsquo;s
number. The man-servant answered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His lordship is in his bath, sir. Shall I put you through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<p>The telephone clucked again. Presently Lord Peter&rsquo;s voice
came faintly, &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the landlady mention where Bertha Gotobed was
employed?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;she was a waitress at the Corner House. Why this
interest all of a sudden? You snub me in my bed, but you woo
me in my bath. It sounds like a music-hall song of the less
refined sort. Why, oh why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen the papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I leave those follies till breakfast-time. What&rsquo;s up?
Are we ordered to Shanghai? or have they taken sixpence off
the income-tax?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, you fool, it&rsquo;s serious. You&rsquo;re too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bertha Gotobed was found dead in Epping Forest this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God! Dead? How? What of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No idea. Poison or something. Or heart failure. No violence.
No robbery. No clue. I&rsquo;m going down to the Yard about
it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forgive me, Charles. D&rsquo;you know, I had a sort of
awful feeling when you said that ad. could do no harm. Dead.
Poor girl! Charles, I feel like a murderer. Oh, damn! and I&rsquo;m
all wet. It does make one feel so helpless. Look here, you spin
down to the Yard and tell &rsquo;em what you know and I&rsquo;ll join you
there in half a tick. Anyway, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, look here. It may be something quite different.
Nothing to do with your ad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pigs <i>may</i> fly. Use your common sense. Oh! and Charles,
does it mention the sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. There was a letter from her on the body, by which
they identified it. She got married last month and went to
Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s saved her life. She&rsquo;ll be in absolutely horrible danger,
if she comes back. We must get hold of her and warn her.
And find out what she knows. Good-bye. I <i>must</i> get some
clothes on. Oh, hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cluck! the line went dead again, and Mr. Parker, abandoning
the kippers without regret, ran feverishly out of the
house and down Lamb&rsquo;s Conduit Street to catch a diver tram
to Westminster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>The Chief of Scotland Yard, Sir Andrew Mackenzie, was
a very old friend of Lord Peter&rsquo;s. He received that agitated young
man kindly and listened with attention to his slightly involved
story of cancer, wills, mysterious solicitors and advertisements
in the agony column.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a curious coincidence,&rdquo; he said, indulgently, &ldquo;and I
can understand your feeling upset about it. But you may set
your mind at rest. I have the police-surgeon&rsquo;s report, and he
is quite convinced that the death was perfectly natural. No
signs whatever of any assault. They will make an examination,
of course, but I don&rsquo;t think there is the slightest reason to suspect
foul play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what was she doing in Epping Forest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Andrew shrugged gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be inquired into, of course. Still&mdash;young people
<i>do</i> wander about, you know. There&rsquo;s a fianc&eacute; somewhere.
Something to do with the railway, I believe. Collins has gone
down to interview him. Or she may have been with some other
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if the death was natural, no one would leave a sick
or dying girl like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> wouldn&rsquo;t. But say there had been some running
about&mdash;some horse-play&mdash;and the girl fell dead, as these heart
cases sometimes do. The companion may well have taken fright
and cleared out. It&rsquo;s not unheard of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter looked unconvinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long has she been dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About five or six days, our man thinks. It was quite by
accident that she was found then at all; it&rsquo;s quite an unfrequented
part of the Forest. A party of young people were exploring
with a couple of terriers, and one of the dogs nosed
out the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it out in the open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. It lay among some bushes&mdash;the sort of place
where a frolicsome young couple might go to play hide-and-seek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or where a murderer might go to play hide and let the
police seek,&rdquo; said Wimsey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well. Have it your own way,&rdquo; said Sir Andrew,
smiling. &ldquo;If it was murder, it must have been a poisoning job,
for, as I say, there was not the slightest sign of a wound or a
struggle. I&rsquo;ll let you have the report of the autopsy. In the
meanwhile, if you&rsquo;d like to run down there with Inspector
Parker, you can of course have any facilities you want. And if
you discover anything, let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wimsey thanked him, and collecting Parker from an adjacent
office, rushed him briskly down the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is, of course, it&rsquo;s very gratifying
to know that our first steps in psychology have led to
action, so to speak, but I wish to God it hadn&rsquo;t been quite such
decisive action. We&rsquo;d better trot down to Epping straight away,
and see the landlady later. I&rsquo;ve got a new car, by the way, which
you&rsquo;ll like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker took one look at the slim black monster, with
its long rakish body and polished-copper twin exhausts, and
decided there and then that the only hope of getting down to
Epping without interference was to look as official as possible
and wave his police authority under the eyes of every man in
blue along the route. He shoe-horned himself into his seat
without protest, and was more unnerved than relieved to find
himself shoot suddenly ahead of the traffic&mdash;not with the bellowing
roar of the ordinary racing engine, but in a smooth,
uncanny silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new Daimler Twin-Six,&rdquo; said Lord Peter, skimming
dexterously round a lorry without appearing to look at it. &ldquo;With
a racing body. Specially built&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. useful&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gadgets&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no row&mdash;hate
row&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like Edmund Sparkler&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. very anxious there should
be no row&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Little Dorrit&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. remember&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. call her Mrs. Merdle
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for that reason&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. presently we&rsquo;ll see what she can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The promise was fulfilled before their arrival at the spot
where the body had been found. Their arrival made a considerable
sensation among the little crowd which business or curiosity
had drawn to the spot. Lord Peter was instantly pounced
upon by four reporters and a synod of Press photographers,
whom his presence encouraged in the hope that the mystery
might turn out to be a three-column splash after all. Parker,
to his annoyance, was photographed in the undignified act of
extricating himself from &ldquo;Mrs. Merdle.&rdquo; Superintendent Walmisley
came politely to his assistance, rebuked the onlookers,
and led him to the scene of action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The body had been already removed to the mortuary, but
a depression in the moist ground showed clearly enough where
it had lain. Lord Peter groaned faintly as he saw it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn this nasty warm spring weather,&rdquo; he said, with
feeling. &ldquo;April showers&mdash;sun and water&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t be worse.
Body much altered, Superintendent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, rather, my lord, especially in the exposed parts.
But there&rsquo;s no doubt about the identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose there was. How was it lying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the back, quite quiet and natural-like. No disarrangement
of clothing, or anything. She must just have sat down
when she felt herself bad and fallen back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;m. The rain has spoilt any footprints or signs on the
ground. And it&rsquo;s grassy. Beastly stuff, grass, eh, Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. These twigs don&rsquo;t seem to have been broken at all,
Superintendent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the officer, &ldquo;no signs of a struggle, as I
pointed out in my report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but if she&rsquo;d sat down here and fallen back as you
suggest, don&rsquo;t you think her weight would have snapped some
of these young shoots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Superintendent glanced sharply at the Scotland Yard
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose she was brought and put here, do you,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose anything,&rdquo; retorted Parker, &ldquo;I merely drew
attention to a point which I think you should consider. What
are these wheel-marks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our car, sir. We backed it up here and took her up
that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all this trampling is your men too, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly that, sir, and partly the party as found her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You noticed no other person&rsquo;s tracks, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. But it&rsquo;s rained considerably this last week. Besides,
the rabbits have been all over the place, as you can see,
and other creatures too, I fancy. Weasels, or something of that
sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Well, I think you&rsquo;d better take a look round. There
might be traces of some kind a bit further away. Make a circle,
and report anything you see. And you oughtn&rsquo;t to have let all
that bunch of people get so near. Put a cordon round and tell
&rsquo;em to move on. Have you seen all you want, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wimsey had been poking his stick aimlessly into the bole
of an oak-tree at a few yards&rsquo; distance. Now he stooped and
lifted out a package which had been stuffed into a cleft. The
two policemen hurried forward with eager interest, which evaporated
somewhat at sight of the find&mdash;a ham sandwich and an
empty Bass bottle, roughly wrapped up in a greasy newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picnickers,&rdquo; said Walmisley, with a snort. &ldquo;Nothing to do
with the body, I daresay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re mistaken,&rdquo; said Wimsey, placidly. &ldquo;When
did the girl disappear, exactly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she went off duty at the Corner House at five a
week ago to-morrow, that&rsquo;s Wednesday, 27th,&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the <i>Evening Views</i> of Wednesday, 27th,&rdquo; said
Wimsey. &ldquo;Late Final edition. Now that edition isn&rsquo;t on the
streets till about 6 o&rsquo;clock. So unless somebody brought it down
and had supper here, it was probably brought by the girl herself
or her companion. It&rsquo;s hardly likely anyone would come and
picnic here afterwards, not with the body there. Not that bodies
need necessarily interfere with one&rsquo;s enjoyment of one&rsquo;s food.
&Agrave; la guerre comme &agrave; la guerre. But for the moment there isn&rsquo;t
a war on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, sir. But you&rsquo;re assuming the death took place
on the Wednesday or Thursday. She may have been somewhere
else&mdash;living with someone in town or anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crushed again,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;Still, it&rsquo;s a curious coincidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, my lord, and I&rsquo;m very glad you found the things.
Will you take charge of &rsquo;em, Mr. Parker, or shall I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better take them along and put them with the other things,&rdquo;
said Parker, extending his hand to take them from Wimsey,
whom they seemed to interest quite disproportionately. &ldquo;I fancy
his lordship&rsquo;s right and that the parcel came here along with
the girl. And that certainly looks as if she didn&rsquo;t come alone.
Possibly that young man of hers was with her. Looks like the
old, old story. Take care of that bottle, old man, it may have
finger-prints on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have the bottle,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;May we ne&rsquo;er
lack a friend or a bottle to give him, as Dick Swiveller says.
But I earnestly beg that before you caution your respectable
young railway clerk that anything he says may be taken down
and used against him, you will cast your eye, and your nose,
upon this ham sandwich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with it?&rdquo; inquired Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. It appears to be in astonishingly good preservation,
thanks to this admirable oak-tree. The stalwart oak&mdash;for
so many centuries Britain&rsquo;s bulwark against the invader!
Heart of oak are our ships&mdash;not hearts, by the way, as it is
usually misquoted. But I am puzzled by the incongruity between
the sandwich and the rest of the outfit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ordinary ham sandwich, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, gods of the wine-flask and the board, how long? how
long?&mdash;it is a ham sandwich, Goth, but not an ordinary one.
Never did it see Lyons&rsquo; kitchen, or the counter of the multiple
store or the delicatessen shop in the back street. The pig that
was sacrificed to make this dainty titbit fattened in no dull style,
never knew the daily ration of pig-wash or the not unmixed
rapture of the domestic garbage-pail. Observe the hard texture,
the deep brownish tint of the lean; the rich fat, yellow as a
Chinaman&rsquo;s cheek; the dark spot where the black treacle cure
has soaked in, to make a dish fit to lure Zeus from Olympus.
And tell me, man of no discrimination and worthy to be fed
on boiled cod all the year round, tell me how it comes that
your little waitress and her railway clerk come down to Epping
Forest to regale themselves on sandwiches made from coal-black,
treacle-cured Bradenham ham, which long ago ran as
a young wild boar about the woodlands, till death translated it
to an incorruptible and more glorious body? I may add that it
costs about 3s. a pound uncooked&mdash;an argument which you
will allow to be weighty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd, certainly,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;I imagine that only
rich people&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only rich people or people who understand eating as a
fine art,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;The two classes are by no means
identical, though they occasionally overlap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be very important,&rdquo; said Parker, wrapping the
exhibits up carefully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go along now and see the
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The examination was not a very pleasant matter, for the
weather had been damp and warm and there had certainly
been weasels. In fact, after a brief glance, Wimsey left the two
policemen to carry on alone, and devoted his attention to the
dead girl&rsquo;s handbag. He glanced through the letter from Evelyn
Gotobed&mdash;(now Evelyn Cropper)&mdash;&mdash;and noted down the Canadian
address. He turned the cutting of his own advertisement
out of an inner compartment, and remained for some time in
consideration of the &pound;5 note which lay, folded up, side by side
with a 10<i>s.</i> Treasury note, 7<i>s.</i>, 8<i>d.</i> in silver and copper, a latch-key
and a powder compacte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re having this note traced, Walmisley, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, my lord, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the latch-key, I imagine, belongs to the girl&rsquo;s lodgings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt it does. We have asked her landlady to come
and identify the body. Not that there&rsquo;s any doubt about it, but
just as a matter of routine. She may give us some help. Ah!&rdquo;&mdash;the
Superintendent peered out of the mortuary door&mdash;&ldquo;I think
this must be the lady.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>The stout and motherly woman who emerged from a taxi
in charge of a youthful policeman identified the body without
difficulty, and amid many sobs, as that of Bertha Gotobed.
&ldquo;Such a nice young lady,&rdquo; she mourned. &ldquo;What a terrible thing,
oh, dear! who would go to do a thing like that? I&rsquo;ve been in
such a state of worriment ever since she didn&rsquo;t come home last
Wednesday. I&rsquo;m sure many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve said to myself I wished
I&rsquo;d had my tongue cut out before I ever showed her that wicked
advertisement. Ah, I see you&rsquo;ve got it there, sir. A dreadful
thing it is that people should be luring young girls away with
stories about something to their advantage. A sinful old devil&mdash;calling
himself a lawyer, too! When she didn&rsquo;t come back and
didn&rsquo;t come back I wrote to the wretch, telling him I was on
his track and was coming round to have the law on him as
sure as my name&rsquo;s Dorcas Gulliver. He wouldn&rsquo;t have got round
me&mdash;not that I&rsquo;d be the bird he was looking for, being sixty-one
come Mid-Summer Day&mdash;and so I told him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter&rsquo;s gravity was somewhat upset by this diatribe
against the highly respectable Mr. Murbles of Staple Inn, whose
own version of Mrs. Gulliver&rsquo;s communication had been decently
expurgated. &ldquo;How shocked the old boy must have been,&rdquo;
he murmured to Parker. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for it next time I see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gulliver&rsquo;s voice moaned on and on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such respectable girls, both of them, and Miss Evelyn
married to that nice young man from Canada. Deary me, it
will be a terrible upset for her. And there&rsquo;s poor John Ironsides,
was to have married Miss Bertha, the poor lamb, this very
Whitsuntide as ever is. A very steady, respectable man&mdash;a clurk
on the Southern, which he always used to say, joking like,
&lsquo;Slow but safe, like the Southern&mdash;that&rsquo;s me, Mrs. G.&rsquo; T&rsquo;ch,
t&rsquo;ch&mdash;who&rsquo;d a&rsquo; believed it? And it&rsquo;s not as if she was one of
the flighty sort. I give her a latch-key gladly, for she&rsquo;d sometimes
be on late duty, but never any staying out after her time. That&rsquo;s
why it worried me so, her not coming back. There&rsquo;s many
nowadays as would wash one&rsquo;s hands and glad to be rid of
them, knowing what they might be up to. No. When the time
passed and she didn&rsquo;t come back, I said, Mark my words, I
said, she&rsquo;s bin kidnapped, I said, by that Murbles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had she been long with you, Mrs. Gulliver?&rdquo; asked Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not above a fifteen month or so, she hadn&rsquo;t, but bless
you, I don&rsquo;t have to know a young lady fifteen days to know
if she&rsquo;s a good girl or not. You gets to know by the look of &rsquo;em
almost, when you&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad my experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she and her sister come to you together?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;They did. They come to me when they was lookin&rsquo; for
work in London. And they could a&rsquo; fallen into a deal worse
hands I can tell you, two young things from the country, and
them that fresh and pretty looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were uncommonly lucky, I&rsquo;m sure, Mrs. Gulliver,&rdquo;
said Lord Peter, &ldquo;and they must have found it a great comfort
to be able to confide in you and get your good advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think they did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gulliver, &ldquo;not that
young people nowadays seems to want much guidance from
them as is older. Train up a child and away she go, as the
Good Book says. But Miss Evelyn, that&rsquo;s now Mrs. Cropper&mdash;she&rsquo;d
had this London idea put into her head, and up they
comes with the idea of bein&rsquo; made ladies of, havin&rsquo; only been
in service before, though what&rsquo;s the difference between serving
in one of them tea-shops at the beck of all the nasty tagrag and
bobtail and serving in a lady&rsquo;s home, I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> see, except that
you works harder and don&rsquo;t get your meals so comfortable.
Still, Miss Evelyn, she was always the go-ahead one of the
two, and she did very well for herself, I will say, meetin&rsquo; Mr.
Cropper as used to take his breakfast regular at the Corner
House every morning and took a liking to the girl in the most
honourable way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very fortunate. Have you any idea what gave
them the notion of coming to town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, sir, it&rsquo;s funny you should ask that, because it
was a thing I never could understand. The lady as they used
to be in service with, down in the country, she put it into Miss
Evelyn&rsquo;s head. Now, sir, wouldn&rsquo;t you think that with good
service that &rsquo;ard to come by, she&rsquo;d have done all she could to
keep them with her? But no! There was a bit of trouble one
day, it seems, over Bertha&mdash;this poor girl here, poor lamb&mdash;it
do break one&rsquo;s &rsquo;eart to see her like that, don&rsquo;t it, sir?&mdash;over
Bertha &rsquo;avin&rsquo; broke an old teapot&mdash;a very valuable one by all
accounts, and the lady told &rsquo;er she couldn&rsquo;t put up with &rsquo;avin&rsquo;
her things broke no more. So she says: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to go,&rsquo; she
says, &lsquo;but,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a very good character and
you&rsquo;ll soon get a good place. And I expect Evelyn&rsquo;ll want to
go with you,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;so I&rsquo;ll have to find someone else to do
for me,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;why not go to London? You&rsquo;ll
do better there and have a much more interesting life than
what you would at home,&rsquo; she says. And the end of it was, she
filled &rsquo;em up so with stories of how fine a place London was
and how grand situations was to be had for the asking, that
they was mad to go, and she give them a present of money
and behaved very handsome, take it all round.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;she seems to have been very particular
about her teapot. Was Bertha a great crockery-breaker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, she never broke nothing of mine. But this Miss
Whittaker&mdash;that was the name&mdash;she was one of these opinionated
ladies, as will &rsquo;ave their own way in everythink. A fine
temper she &rsquo;ad, or so poor Bertha said, though Miss Evelyn&mdash;her
as is now Mrs. Cropper&mdash;<i>she</i> always &rsquo;ad an idea as there
was somethink at the back of it. Miss Evelyn was always the
sharp one, as you might say. But there, sir, we all &rsquo;as our
peculiarities, don&rsquo;t we? It&rsquo;s my own belief as the lady had
somebody of her own choice as she wanted to put in the place
of Bertha&mdash;that&rsquo;s this one&mdash;and Evelyn&mdash;as is now Mrs.
Cropper, you understand me&mdash;and she jest trampled up an
excuse, as they say, to get rid of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very possibly,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;I suppose, Inspector, Evelyn
Gotobed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Mrs. Cropper,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Gulliver with a sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Cropper, I should say&mdash;has been communicated
with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, my lord. We cabled her at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. I wish you&rsquo;d let me know when you hear from
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be in touch with Inspector Parker, my lord, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Well, Charles, I&rsquo;m going to leave you to it.
I&rsquo;ve got a telegram to send. Or will you come with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, no,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;To be frank, I don&rsquo;t like your
methods of driving. Being in the Force, I prefer to keep on
the windy side of the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Windy is the word for you,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in

</div>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Wimsey, as Parker was ushered in that same evening
by Bunter, &ldquo;have you got anything fresh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve got a new theory of the crime, which knocks
yours into a cocked hat. I&rsquo;ve got evidence to support it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which crime, by the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the Epping Forest business. I don&rsquo;t believe the old
Dawson person was murdered at all. That&rsquo;s just an idea of
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. And you&rsquo;re now going to tell me that Bertha Gotobed
was got hold of by the White Slave people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; asked Parker, a little peevishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Scotland Yard have two maggots which crop up
whenever anything happens to a young woman. Either it&rsquo;s
White Slavery or Dope Dens&mdash;sometimes both. You are going
to say it&rsquo;s both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was, as a matter of fact. It so often is, you know.
We&rsquo;ve traced the &pound;5 note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s important, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It seems to me to be the clue to the whole thing. It
is one of a series paid out to a Mrs. Forrest, living in South
Audley Street. I&rsquo;ve been round to make some inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she was out. She usually is, I&rsquo;m told. In fact, her
habits seem to be expensive, irregular and mysterious. She has
an elegantly furnished flat over a flower-shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A service flat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. One of the quiet kind, with a lift you work yourself.
She only turns up occasionally, mostly in the evenings, spends
a night or two and departs. Food ordered in from Fortnum
and Mason&rsquo;s. Bills paid promptly by note or cheque. Cleaning
done by an elderly female who comes in about eleven, by
which time Mrs. Forrest has usually gone out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t anybody ever see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, yes! The people in the flat below and the girl
at the flower-shop were able to give me quite a good description
of her. Tall, over-dressed, musquash and those abbreviated sort
of shoes with jewelled heels and hardly any uppers&mdash;you know
the sort of thing. Heavily peroxided; strong aroma of origan
wafted out upon the passer-by; powder too white for the fashion
and mouth heavily obscured with sealing-wax red; eyebrows
painted black to startle, not deceive; finger-nails a monument
to Kraska&mdash;the pink variety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d no idea you studied the Woman&rsquo;s Page to such good
purpose, Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drives a Renault Four-seater, dark green with tapestry
doings. Garages just round the corner. I&rsquo;ve seen the man, and
he says the car was out on the night of the 27th. Went out at
11:30. Returned about 8 the next morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much petrol had been used?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We worked that out. Just about enough for a run to
Epping and back. What&rsquo;s more, the charwoman says that there
had been supper for two in the flat that night, and three bottles
of champagne drunk. Also, there is a ham in the flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Bradenham ham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you expect the charwoman to know that? But I
think it probably is, as I find from Fortnum &amp; Mason&rsquo;s that a
Bradenham ham was delivered to Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s address about
a fortnight ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds conclusive. I take it you think Bertha Gotobed
was inveigled there for some undesirable purpose by Mrs.
Forrest, and had supper with her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I should think there was a man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Mrs. F. brings the parties together and
leaves them to it. The poor girl is made thoroughly drunk&mdash;and
then something untoward happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;shock, perhaps, or a shot of dope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they bustle her off and get rid of her. It&rsquo;s quite
possible. The post-mortem may tell us something about it. Yes,
Bunter, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The telephone, my lord, for Mr. Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;I asked the people at the flower-shop
to ring me up here, if Mrs. Forrest came in. If she&rsquo;s there,
would you like to come round with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker returned from the telephone with an air of subdued
triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just gone up to her flat. Come along. We&rsquo;ll take a
taxi&mdash;not that death-rattle of yours. Hurry up, I don&rsquo;t want to
miss her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door of the flat in South Audley Street was opened
by Mrs. Forrest in person. Wimsey recognised her instantly
from the description. On seeing Parker&rsquo;s card, she made no
objection whatever to letting them in, and led the way into a
pink and mauve sitting-room, obviously furnished by contract
from a Regent Street establishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please sit down. Will you smoke? And your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My colleague, Mr. Templeton,&rdquo; said Parker, promptly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s rather hard eyes appeared to sum up in a
practised manner the difference between Parker&rsquo;s seven-guinea
&ldquo;fashionable lounge suiting, tailored in our own workrooms,
fits like a made-to-measure suit,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;colleague&rsquo;s&rdquo; Savile
Row outlines, but beyond a slight additional defensiveness of
manner she showed no disturbance. Parker noted the glance.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s summing us up professionally,&rdquo; was his mental comment,
&ldquo;and she&rsquo;s not quite sure whether Wimsey&rsquo;s an outraged
brother or husband or what. Never mind. Let her wonder. We
may get her rattled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are engaged, Madam,&rdquo; he began, with formal severity,
&ldquo;on an inquiry relative to certain events connected with the
26th of last month. I think you were in Town at that time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Mrs. Forrest frowned slightly in the effort to recollect.
Wimsey made a mental note that she was not as young as her
bouffant apple-green frock made her appear. She was certainly
nearing the thirties, and her eyes were mature and aware.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I was. Yes, certainly. I was in Town for several
days about that time. How can I help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a question of a certain bank-note which has been
traced to your possession,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;a &pound;5 note numbered
x/y58929. It was issued to you by Lloyds Bank in payment of
a cheque on the 19th.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely. I can&rsquo;t say I remember the number, but I
think I cashed a cheque about that time. I can tell in a moment
by my cheque-book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary. But it would help us very
much if you can recollect to whom you paid it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. Well, that&rsquo;s rather difficult. I paid my dressmaker&rsquo;s
about that time&mdash;no, that was by cheque. I paid cash
to the garage, I know, and I think there was a &pound;5 note in that.
Then I dined at Verry&rsquo;s with a woman friend&mdash;that took the
second &pound;5 note, I remember, but there was a third. I drew out
&pound;25&mdash;three fives and ten ones. Where did the third note go?
Oh, of course, how stupid of me! I put it on a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through a Commission Agent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I had nothing much to do one day, so I went down
to Newmarket. I put the &pound;5 on some creature called Brighteye
or Attaboy or some name like that, at 50 to 1. Of course the
wretched animal didn&rsquo;t win, they never do. A man in the train
gave me the tip and wrote the name down for me. I handed
it to the nearest bookie I saw&mdash;a funny little grey-haired man
with a hoarse voice&mdash;and that was the last I saw of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you remember which day it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it was Saturday. Yes, I&rsquo;m sure it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much, Mrs. Forrest. It will be a great
help if we can trace those notes. One of them has turned up
since in&mdash;other circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I know what the circumstances are, or is it an official
secret?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Parker hesitated. He rather wished now, that he had demanded
point-blank at the start how Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s &pound;5 note had
come to be found on the dead body of the waitress at Epping.
Taken by surprise, the woman might have got flustered. Now,
he had let her entrench herself securely behind this horse story.
Impossible to follow up the history of a bank-note handed to
an unknown bookie at a race-meeting. Before he could speak,
Wimsey broke in for the first time, in a high, petulant voice
which quite took his friend aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not getting anywhere with all this,&rdquo; he complained.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a continental curse about the beastly
note, and I&rsquo;m sure Sylvia doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Sylvia?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Forrest with considerable
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Sylvia? What is she?&rdquo; gabbled Wimsey, irrepressibly.
&ldquo;Shakespeare always has the right word, hasn&rsquo;t he? But,
God bless my soul, it&rsquo;s no laughing matter. It&rsquo;s very serious
and you&rsquo;ve no business to laugh at it. Sylvia is very much
upset, and the doctor is afraid it may have an effect on her
heart. You may not know it, Mrs. Forrest, but Sylvia Lyndhurst
is my cousin. And what she wants to know, and what we all
want to know&mdash;don&rsquo;t interrupt me, Inspector, all this shilly-shallying
doesn&rsquo;t get us anywhere&mdash;I want to know, Mrs. Forrest,
who was it dining here with you on the night of April
26th. Who was it? Who was it? Can you tell me that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time, Mrs. Forrest was visibly taken aback. Even
under the thick coat of powder they could see the red flush up
into her cheeks and ebb away, while her eyes took on an expression
of something more than alarm&mdash;a kind of vicious fury,
such as one may see in those of a cornered cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 26th?&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; cried Wimsey. &ldquo;And that girl Evelyn was sure
of it too. Who was it, Mrs. Forrest? Answer me that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there was no one,&rdquo; said Mrs. Forrest, with a
thick gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, Mrs. Forrest, think again,&rdquo; said Parker, taking
his cue promptly, &ldquo;you aren&rsquo;t going to tell us that you accounted
by yourself for three bottles of Veuve Clicquot and two people&rsquo;s
dinners.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not forgetting the ham,&rdquo; put in Wimsey, with fussy self-importance,
&ldquo;the Bradenham ham specially cooked and sent
up by Fortnum &amp; Mason. Now, Mrs. Forrest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment. Just a moment. I&rsquo;ll tell you everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s hands clutched at the pink silk cushions,
making little hot, tight creases. &ldquo;I&mdash;would you mind getting
me something to drink? In the dining-room, through there&mdash;on
the sideboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wimsey got up quickly and disappeared into the next room.
He took rather a long time, Parker thought. Mrs. Forrest was
lying back in a collapsed attitude, but her breathing was more
controlled, and she was, he thought, recovering her wits. &ldquo;Making
up a story,&rdquo; he muttered savagely to himself. However, he
could not, without brutality, press her at the moment.</p>
<p>Lord Peter, behind the folding doors, was making a good
deal of noise, chinking the glasses and fumbling about. However,
before very long, he was back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Scuse my taking such a time,&rdquo; he apologised, handing
Mrs. Forrest a glass of brandy and soda. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t find the
syphon. Always was a bit wool-gathering, y&rsquo;know. All my friends
say so. Starin&rsquo; me in the face all the time, what? And then I
sloshed a lot of soda on the sideboard. Hand shakin&rsquo;. Nerves
all to pieces and so on. Feelin&rsquo; better? That&rsquo;s right. Put it down.
That&rsquo;s the stuff to pull you together. How about another little
one, what? Oh, rot, it can&rsquo;t hurt you. Mind if I have one
myself? I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo; a bit flustered. Upsettin&rsquo;, delicate business
and all that. Just another spot. That&rsquo;s the idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He trotted out again, glass in hand, while Parker fidgeted.
The presence of amateur detectives was sometimes an embarrassment.
Wimsey clattered in again, this time, with more
common sense, bringing decanter, syphon and three glasses,
bodily, on a tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;now we&rsquo;re feeling better, do
you think you can answer our question, Mrs. Forrest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I know, first of all, what right you have to ask it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker shot an exasperated glance at his friend. This came
of giving people time to think.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right?&rdquo; burst in Wimsey. &ldquo;Right? Of course, we&rsquo;ve a right.
The police have a right to ask questions when anything&rsquo;s the
matter. Here&rsquo;s murder the matter! Right, indeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A curious intent look came into her eyes. Parker could
not place it, but Wimsey recognised it instantly. He had seen
it last on the face of a great financier as he took up his pen to
sign a contract. Wimsey had been called to witness the signature,
and had refused. It was a contract that ruined thousands
of people. Incidentally, the financier had been murdered soon
after, and Wimsey had declined to investigate the matter, with
a sentence from Dumas: &ldquo;Let pass the justice of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; Mrs. Forrest was saying, &ldquo;that in that case I
can&rsquo;t help you. I <i>did</i> have a friend dining with me on the 26th,
but he has not, so far as I know, been murdered, nor has he
murdered anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a man, then?&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<p>Mrs. Forrest bowed her head with a kind of mocking
ruefulness. &ldquo;I live apart from my husband,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;to have to press for this gentleman&rsquo;s
name and address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that asking rather much? Perhaps if you would give
me further details&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; cut in Wimsey again, &ldquo;if we could just
know for certain it wasn&rsquo;t Lyndhurst. My cousin is so frightfully
upset, as I said, and that Evelyn girl is making trouble. In
fact&mdash;of course one doesn&rsquo;t want it to go any further&mdash;but
actually Sylvia lost her head very completely. She made a savage
attack on poor old Lyndhurst&mdash;with a revolver, in fact, only
fortunately she is a shocking bad shot. It went over his shoulder
and broke a vase&mdash;most distressin&rsquo; thing&mdash;a Famille Rose jar,
worth thousands&mdash;and of course it was smashed to atoms.
Sylvia is really hardly responsible when she&rsquo;s in a temper. And,
we thought, as Lyndhurst was actually traced to this block of
flats&mdash;if you could give us definite proof it wasn&rsquo;t him, it might
calm her down and prevent murder being done, don&rsquo;t you
know. Because, though they might call it Guilty but Insane,
still, it would be awfully awkward havin&rsquo; one&rsquo;s cousin in Broadmoor&mdash;a
first cousin, and really a very nice woman, when
she&rsquo;s not irritated.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Mrs. Forrest gradually softened into a faint smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I understand the position, Mr. Templeton,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and if I give you a name, it will be in strict confidence,
I presume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;Dear me, I&rsquo;m sure
it&rsquo;s uncommonly kind of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll swear you aren&rsquo;t spies of my husband&rsquo;s?&rdquo; she said,
quickly. &ldquo;I am trying to divorce him. How do I know this isn&rsquo;t
a trap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Wimsey, with intense gravity, &ldquo;I swear to
you on my honour as a gentleman that I have not the slightest
connection with your husband. I have never even heard of
him before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Forrest shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think, after all,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it would be much good
my giving you the name. In any case, if you asked him whether
he&rsquo;d been here, he would say no, wouldn&rsquo;t he? And if you&rsquo;ve
been sent by my husband, you&rsquo;ve got all the evidence you want
already. But I give you my solemn assurance, Mr. Templeton,
that I know nothing about your friend, Mr. Lyndhurst&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Lyndhurst,&rdquo; put in Wimsey, plaintively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if Mrs. Lyndhurst is not satisfied, and likes to come
round and see me, I will do my best to satisfy her of the fact.
Will that do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s as
much as any one could expect. You&rsquo;ll forgive my abruptness,
won&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m rather&mdash;er&mdash;nervously constituted, and the
whole business is exceedingly upsetting. <i>Good</i> afternoon. Come
on, Inspector, it&rsquo;s quite all right&mdash;you see it&rsquo;s quite all right.
I&rsquo;m really very much obliged&mdash;uncommonly so. Please don&rsquo;t
trouble to see us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He teetered nervously down the narrow hall-way, in his
imbecile and well-bred way, Parker following with a policeman-like
stiffness. No sooner, however, had the flat-door closed
behind them than Wimsey seized his friend by the arm and
bundled him helter-skelter into the lift.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we should never get away,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;Now
quick&mdash;how do we get round to the back of these flats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with the back?&rdquo; demanded Parker,
annoyed. &ldquo;And I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t stampede me like this. I&rsquo;ve
no business to let you come with me on a job at all, and if I
do, you might have the decency to keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said Wimsey, cheerfully, &ldquo;just let&rsquo;s do this
little bit and you can get all the virtuous indignation off your
chest later on. Round here, I fancy, up this back alley. Step
lively and mind the dust-bin. One, two, three, four&mdash;here we
are! Just keep a look-out for the passing stranger, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Selecting a back window which he judged to belong to
Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s flat, Wimsey promptly grasped a drain-pipe and
began to swarm up it with the agility of a cat-burglar. About
fifteen feet from the ground he paused, reached up, and appeared
to detach something with a quick jerk, and then slid
very gingerly to the ground again, holding his right hand at a
cautious distance from his body, as though it were breakable.</p>
<p>And indeed, to his amazement, Parker observed that Wimsey
now held a long-stemmed glass in his fingers, similar to
those from which they had drunk in Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth&mdash;?&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! I&rsquo;m Hawkshaw the detective&mdash;gathering finger-prints.
Here we come a-wassailing and gathering prints in May.
That&rsquo;s why I took the glass back. I brought a different one in
the second time. Sorry I had to do this athletic stunt, but the
only cotton-reel I could find hadn&rsquo;t much on it. When I changed
the glass, I tip-toed into the bathroom and hung it out of the
window. Hope she hasn&rsquo;t been in there since. Just brush my
bags down, will you, old man? Gently&mdash;don&rsquo;t touch the glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil do you want finger-prints for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a grateful sort of person. Why, for all you know,
Mrs. Forrest is someone the Yard has been looking for for years.
And anyway, you could compare the prints with those on the
Bass bottle, if any. Besides, you never know when finger-prints
mayn&rsquo;t come in handy. They&rsquo;re excellent things to have about
the house. Coast clear? Right. Hail a taxi, will you? I can&rsquo;t
wave my hand with this glass in it. Look so silly, don&rsquo;t you
know. I say!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw something else. The first time I went out for the
drinks, I had a peep into her bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think I found in the wash-stand drawer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hypodermic syringe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and an innocent little box of ampull&aelig;, with a
doctor&rsquo;s prescription headed &lsquo;The injection, Mrs. Forrest. One
to be injected when the pain is very severe.&rsquo; What do you think
of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you when we&rsquo;ve got the results of that post-mortem,&rdquo;
said Parker, really impressed. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t bring the prescription,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I didn&rsquo;t inform the lady who we were or what
we were after or ask her permission to carry away the family
crystal. But I made a note of the chemist&rsquo;s address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; ejaculated Parker. &ldquo;Occasionally, my lad, you
have some glimmerings of sound detective sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;Fair View,&rdquo;</span>
<span class="jr">Nelson Avenue,</span>
<span class="jr">Leahampton.</span>
<span class="jr">12 May, 1927.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">My dear Lord Peter</span>,</p>
<p>I have not <i>yet</i> been able to get <span class="small">ALL</span> the information you
ask for, as Miss Whittaker has been away for some weeks,
inspecting <i>chicken-farms</i>!! With a view to purchase, I mean of
course, and not in any <i>sanitary capacity</i>(!). I <i>really think</i> she
means to set up farming <i>with Miss Findlater</i>, though what Miss
Whittaker can see in that very gushing and really <i>silly</i> young
woman I cannot think. However, Miss Findlater has evidently
quite a &ldquo;pash&rdquo; (as we used to call it at school) for Miss Whittaker,
and I am afraid none of us are being <i>flattered</i> by such outspoken
admiration. I must say, I think it rather <i>unhealthy</i>&mdash;you may
remember Miss Clemence Dane&rsquo;s <i>very clever book</i> on the subject?&mdash;I
have seen so <i>much</i> of that kind of thing in my rather
<span class="small">WOMAN-RIDDEN</span> existence! It has such a bad effect, as a rule,
upon the <i>weaker character</i> of the two&mdash;But I must not take up
your time with my <span class="small">TWADDLE</span>!!</p>
<p>Miss Murgatroyd, who was quite a friend of old <i>Miss
Dawson</i>, however, has been able to tell me a <i>little</i> about her
past life.</p>
<p>It seems that, until five years ago, Miss Dawson lived in
Warwickshire with her cousin, a Miss Clara Whittaker, Mary
Whittaker&rsquo;s great-aunt on the <i>father&rsquo;s</i> side. This Miss Clara was
evidently rather a &ldquo;character,&rdquo; as my dear father used to call
it. In her day she was considered very &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; and <i>not quite
nice</i>(!) because she <i>refused</i> several <i>good offers</i>, cut her hair
short(!!) and set up in business for herself as a <span class="small">HORSE-BREEDER</span>!!!
Of course, <i>nowadays</i>, nobody would think anything of it, but
<i>then</i> the old lady&mdash;or <i>young</i> lady as she was when she embarked
on this <i>revolutionary</i> proceeding, was quite a <span class="small">PIONEER</span>.</p>
<p>Agatha Dawson was a school-fellow of hers, and <i>deeply
attached</i> to her. And as a result of this friendship, Agatha&rsquo;s
<i>sister</i>, <span class="sc">Harriet</span>, married Clara Whittaker&rsquo;s brother <span class="sc">James</span>! But
<i>Agatha</i> did not care about marriage, any more than <i>Clara</i>,
and the two ladies lived together in a big old house, with
immense stables, in a village in Warwickshire&mdash;Crofton, I think
the name was. Clara Whittaker turned out to be a remarkably
<i>good business woman</i>, and worked up a big connection among
the <i>hunting folk</i> in those parts. Her hunters became quite
<i>famous</i>, and from a capital of a few thousand pounds with
which she started she made quite a <i>fortune</i>, and was a <i>very
rich woman</i> before her death! Agatha Dawson never had anything
to do with the <i>horsey</i> part of the business. She was the
&ldquo;domestic&rdquo; partner, and looked after the <i>house</i> and the <i>servants</i>.</p>
<p>When Clara Whittaker died, she left <i>all her money</i> to
Agatha, passing over her <i>own family</i>, with whom she was <i>not
on very good terms</i>&mdash;owing to the narrow-minded attitude they
had taken up about her horse-dealing!! Her nephew, Charles
Whittaker, who was a clergyman, and the father of <i>our</i> Miss
Whittaker, resented very much not getting the money, though,
as he had kept up the feud in a very <i>un-Christian</i> manner, he
had really <i>no right</i> to complain, especially as Clara had built
up her fortune <i>entirely</i> by her own exertions. But, of course,
he inherited the <i>bad, old-fashioned</i> idea that women <i>ought not</i>
to be their own mistresses, or make money for themselves, or
do what they liked with their own!</p>
<p>He and his family were the only surviving Whittaker relations,
and when <i>he and his wife</i> were killed in a motor-car
accident, Miss Dawson asked Mary to leave her work as a nurse
and make her home with her. So that, you see, Clara Whittaker&rsquo;s
money was destined to <i>come back</i> to James Whittaker&rsquo;s
daughter in the end!! Miss Dawson made it <i>quite</i> <span class="small">CLEAR</span> that
this was her intention, provided Mary would come and <i>cheer
the declining days</i> of a lonely old lady!</p>
<p>Mary accepted, and as her aunt&mdash;or, to speak more <i>exactly</i>,
her great-aunt&mdash;had given up the big old Warwickshire
house after Clara&rsquo;s death, they lived in London for a short time
and then moved to Leahampton. As you know, poor old Miss
Dawson was then already suffering from the <i>terrible disease</i> of
which she died, so that Mary did not have to wait very long
for Clara Whittaker&rsquo;s money!!</p>
<p>I hope this information will be of some <i>use</i> to you. Miss
Murgatroyd did not, of course, know anything about the rest
of the family, but she always understood that there were <i>no
other</i> surviving relatives, either on the Whittaker or the Dawson
side.</p>
<p>When Miss Whittaker returns, I hope to <i>see more</i> of her.
I enclose my <i>account</i> for expenses up to date. I do <i>trust</i> you
will not consider it <i>extravagant</i>. How are your money-lenders
progressing? I was sorry not to see more of those <i>poor women</i>
whose cases I investigated&mdash;their stories were <i>so</i> <span class="small">PATHETIC</span>!</p>
<p><span class="center">I am,</span>
<span class="center"><span class="hst">Very sincerely yours,</span></span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">Alexandra K. Climpson</span>.</span></p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;I <i>forgot</i> to say that Miss Whittaker has a little motor-car.
I do not, of course, know anything about these matters,
but Mrs. Budge&rsquo;s maid tells me that Miss Whittaker&rsquo;s maid says
it is an Austin 7 (is this right?). It is grey, and the number is
XX9917.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker was announced, just as Lord Peter finished
reading this document, and sank rather wearily in a corner of
the chesterfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck?&rdquo; inquired his lordship, tossing the letter over
to him. &ldquo;Do you know, I&rsquo;m beginning to think you were right
about the Bertha Gotobed business, and I&rsquo;m rather relieved. I
don&rsquo;t believe one word of Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s story, for reasons of
my own, and I&rsquo;m now hoping that the wiping out of Bertha
was a pure coincidence and nothing to do with my advertisement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; said Parker, bitterly, helping himself to whisky
and soda. &ldquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;ll be cheered to learn that the
analysis of the body has been made, and that there is not the
slightest sign of foul play. There is no trace of violence or of
poisoning. There was a heart weakness of fairly long standing,
and the verdict is syncope after a heavy meal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t worry me,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;We suggested
shock, you know. Amiable gentleman met at flat of friendly
lady suddenly turns funny after dinner and makes undesirable
overtures. Virtuous young woman is horribly shocked. Weak
heart gives way. Collapse. Exit. Agitation of amiable gentleman
and friendly lady, left with corpse on their hands. Happy thought
motor-car; Epping Forest; <i>exeunt omnes</i>, singing and washing
their hands. Where&rsquo;s the difficulty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proving it is the difficulty, that&rsquo;s all. By the way, there
were no finger-marks on the bottle&mdash;only smears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gloves, I suppose. Which looks like camouflage, anyhow.
An ordinary picnicking couple wouldn&rsquo;t put on gloves to handle
a bottle of Bass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But we can&rsquo;t arrest all the people who wear gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I weep for you, the Walrus said, I deeply sympathise. I
see the difficulty, but it&rsquo;s early days yet. How about those injections?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly O.K. We&rsquo;ve interrogated the chemist and interviewed
the doctor. Mrs. Forrest suffers from violent neuralgic
pains, and the injections were duly prescribed. Nothing wrong
there, and no history of doping or anything. The prescription
is a very mild one, and couldn&rsquo;t possibly be fatal to anybody.
Besides, haven&rsquo;t I told you that there was no trace of morphia
or any other kind of poison in the body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; said Wimsey. He sat for a few minutes looking
thoughtfully at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the case has more or less died out of the papers,&rdquo;
he resumed, suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The analysis has been sent to them, and there will
be a paragraph to-morrow and a verdict of natural death, and
that will be the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. The less fuss there is about it the better. Has
anything been heard of the sister in Canada?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot. Yes. We had a cable three days ago. She&rsquo;s
coming over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she? By Jove! What boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Star of Quebec</i>&mdash;due in next Friday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! We&rsquo;ll have to get hold of her. Are you meeting the
boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, no! Why should I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think someone ought to. I&rsquo;m reassured&mdash;but not altogether
happy. I think I&rsquo;ll go myself, if you don&rsquo;t mind. I want
to get that Dawson story&mdash;and this time I want to make sure
the young woman doesn&rsquo;t have a heart attack before I interview
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really think you&rsquo;re exaggerating, Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better safe than sorry,&rdquo; said his lordship. &ldquo;Have another
peg, won&rsquo;t you? Meanwhile, what do you think of Miss Climpson&rsquo;s
latest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see much in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit confusing, but it all seems quite straightforward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The only thing we know now is that Mary Whittaker&rsquo;s
father was annoyed about Miss Dawson&rsquo;s getting his aunt&rsquo;s
money and thought it ought to have come to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t suspect <i>him</i> of having murdered Miss
Dawson, do you? He died before her, and the daughter&rsquo;s got
the money, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But suppose Miss Dawson had changed her
mind? She might have quarrelled with Mary Whittaker and
wanted to leave her money elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see&mdash;and been put out of the way before she could
make a will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly. Except that all the evidence we have goes
to show that will-making was about the last job anybody could
persuade her to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True&mdash;while she was on good terms with Mary. But how
about that morning Nurse Philliter mentioned, when she said
people were trying to kill her before her time? Mary may really
have been impatient with her for being such an unconscionable
time a-dying. If Miss Dawson became aware of that, she would
certainly have resented it and may very well have expressed an
intention of making her will in someone else&rsquo;s favour&mdash;as a
kind of insurance against premature decease!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t she send for her solicitor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may have tried to. But after all, she was bed-ridden
and helpless. Mary may have prevented the message from being
sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds quite plausible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it? That&rsquo;s why I want Evelyn Cropper&rsquo;s evidence.
I&rsquo;m perfectly certain those girls were packed off because they
had heard more than they should. Or why such enthusiasm
over sending them to London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I thought that part of Mrs. Gulliver&rsquo;s story was a bit
odd. I say, how about the other nurse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nurse Forbes? That&rsquo;s a good idea. I was forgetting her.
Think you can trace her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if you really think it important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. I think it&rsquo;s damned important. Look here, Charles,
you don&rsquo;t seem very enthusiastic about this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, I&rsquo;m not so certain it is a case at all.
What makes you so fearfully keen about it? You seem dead set
on making it a murder, with practically nothing to go upon.
Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter got up and paced the room. The light from
the solitary reading-lamp threw his lean shadow, diffused and
monstrously elongated, up to the ceiling. He walked over to a
book-shelf, and the shadow shrank, blackened, settled down.
He stretched his hand, and the hand&rsquo;s shadow flew with it,
hovering over the gilded titles of the books and blotting them
out one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; repeated Wimsey. &ldquo;Because I believe this is the
case I have always been looking for. The case of cases. The
murder without discernible means, or motive or clue. The
norm. All these&rdquo;&mdash;he swept his extended hand across the book-shelf,
and the shadow outlined a vaster and more menacing
gesture&mdash;&ldquo;all these books on this side of the room are books
about crimes. But they only deal with the abnormal crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by abnormal crimes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The failures. The crimes that have been found out. What
proportion do you suppose they bear to the successful crimes&mdash;the
ones we hear nothing about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this country,&rdquo; said Parker, rather stiffly, &ldquo;we manage
to trace and convict the majority of criminals&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;My good man, I know that where a crime is known to
have been committed, you people manage to catch the perpetrator
in at least sixty per cent of the cases. But the moment
a crime is even suspected, it falls, <i>ipso facto</i>, into the category
of failures. After that, the thing is merely a question of greater
or less efficiency on the part of the police. But how about the
crimes which are never even suspected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can anybody answer that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;one may guess. Read any newspaper to-day. Read
the <i>News of the World</i>. Or, now that the Press has been muzzled,
read the divorce court lists. Wouldn&rsquo;t they give you the
idea that marriage is a failure? Isn&rsquo;t the sillier sort of journalism
packed with articles to the same effect? And yet, looking round
among the marriages you know of personally, aren&rsquo;t the majority
of them a success, in a hum-drum, undemonstrative sort
of way? Only you don&rsquo;t hear of them. People don&rsquo;t bother to
come into court and explain that they dodder along very comfortably
on the whole, thank you. Similarly, if you read all the
books on this shelf, you&rsquo;d come to the conclusion that murder
was a failure. But bless you, it&rsquo;s always the failures that make
the noise. Successful murderers don&rsquo;t write to the papers about
it. They don&rsquo;t even join in imbecile symposia to tell an inquisitive
world &lsquo;What Murder means to me,&rsquo; or &lsquo;How I became
a Successful Poisoner.&rsquo; Happy murderers, like happy wives,
keep quiet tongues. And they probably bear just about the same
proportion to the failures as the divorced couples do to the
happily mated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you putting it rather high?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Nor does anybody. That&rsquo;s the devil of it.
But you ask any doctor, when you&rsquo;ve got him in an unbuttoned,
well-lubricated frame of mind, if he hasn&rsquo;t often had grisly
suspicions which he could not and dared not take steps to verify.
You see by our friend Carr what happens when one doctor is
a trifle more courageous than the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he couldn&rsquo;t prove anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s nothing to be proved.
Look at the scores and scores of murders that have gone unproved
and unsuspected till the fool of a murderer went too
far and did something silly which blew up the whole show.
Palmer, for instance. His wife and brother and mother-in-law
and various illegitimate children, all peacefully put away&mdash;till
he made the mistake of polishing Cook off in that spectacular
manner. Look at George Joseph Smith. Nobody&rsquo;d have thought
of bothering any more about those first two wives he drowned.
It was only when he did it the third time that he aroused
suspicion. Armstrong, too, is supposed to have got away with
many more crimes than he was tried for&mdash;it was being clumsy
over Martin and the Chocolates that stirred up the hornets&rsquo;
nest in the end. Burke and Hare were convicted of murdering
an old woman, and then brightly confessed that they&rsquo;d put
away sixteen people in two months and no one a penny the
wiser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they <i>were</i> caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they were fools. If you murder someone in a
brutal, messy way, or poison someone who had previously
enjoyed rollicking health, or choose the very day after a will&rsquo;s
been made in your favour to extinguish the testator, or go on
killing everyone you meet till people begin to think you&rsquo;re first
cousin to a upas tree, naturally you&rsquo;re found out in the end.
But choose somebody old and ill, in circumstances where the
benefit to yourself isn&rsquo;t too apparent, and use a sensible method
that looks like natural death or accident, and don&rsquo;t repeat your
effects too often, and you&rsquo;re safe. I swear all the heart-diseases
and gastric enteritis and influenzas that get certified are not
nature&rsquo;s unaided work. Murder&rsquo;s so easy, Charles, so damned
easy&mdash;even without special training.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker looked troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in what you say. I&rsquo;ve heard some funny
tales myself. We all do, I suppose. But Miss Dawson&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dawson fascinates me, Charles. Such a beautiful
subject. So old and ill. So likely to die soon. Bound to die
before long. No near relations to make inquiries. No connections
or old friends in the neighbourhood. And so rich. Upon
my soul, Charles, I lie in bed licking my lips over ways and
means of murdering Miss Dawson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow, till you can think of one that defies analysis
and doesn&rsquo;t seem to need a motive, you haven&rsquo;t found the right
one,&rdquo; said Parker, practically, rather revolted by this ghoulish
conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit that,&rdquo; replied Lord Peter, &ldquo;but that only shows
that as yet I&rsquo;m merely a third-rate murderer. Wait till I&rsquo;ve
perfected my method and then I&rsquo;ll show you&mdash;perhaps. Some
wise old buffer has said that each of us holds the life of one
other person between his hands&mdash;but only one, Charles, only
one.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Lord Peter hung up, whistling cheerfully, and called for
Bunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the proper suit to put on, Bunter, when one is
an expectant father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret, my lord, to have seen no recent fashions in
paternity wear. I should say, my lord, whichever suit your
lordship fancies will induce a calm and cheerful frame of mind
in the lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t know the lady. She is, in fact, only
the figment of an over-teeming brain. But I think the garments
should express bright hope, self-congratulations, and a tinge
of tender anxiety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A newly married situation, my lord, I take it. Then I
would suggest the lounge suit in pale grey&mdash;the willow-pussy
cloth, my lord&mdash;with a dull amethyst tie and socks and a soft
hat. I would not recommend a bowler, my lord. The anxiety
expressed in a bowler hat would be rather of the financial kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt you are right, Bunter. And I will wear those
gloves that got so unfortunately soiled yesterday at Charing
Cross. I am too agitated to worry about a clean pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No stick, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Subject to your lordship&rsquo;s better judgment, I should suggest
that a stick may be suitably handled to express emotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are always right, Bunter. Call me a taxi, and tell the
man to drive to Tooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Nurse Forbes regretted very much. She would have liked
to oblige Mr. Simms-Gaythorpe, but she never undertook maternity
work. She wondered who could have misled Mr. Simms-Gaythorpe
by giving him her name.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, y&rsquo;know, I can&rsquo;t say I was misled,&rdquo; said Mr. Simms-Gaythorpe,
dropping his walking-stick and retrieving it with an
ingenuous laugh. &ldquo;Miss Murgatroyd&mdash;you know Miss Murgatroyd
of Leahampton, I think&mdash;yes&mdash;she&mdash;that is, I heard
about you through her&rdquo; (this was a fact), &ldquo;and she said what a
charming person&mdash;excuse my repeatin&rsquo; these personal remarks,
won&rsquo;t you?&mdash;what a charmin&rsquo; person you were and all that,
and how nice it would be if we could persuade you to come,
don&rsquo;t you see. But she said she was afraid perhaps you <i>didn&rsquo;t</i>
do maternity work. Still, y&rsquo;know, I thought it was worth tryin&rsquo;,
what? Bein&rsquo; so anxious, what?&mdash;about my wife, that is, you
see. So necessary to have someone young and cheery at these&mdash;er&mdash;critical
times, don&rsquo;t you know. Maternity nurses often such
ancient and ponderous sort of people&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t mind my
sayin&rsquo; so. My wife&rsquo;s highly nervous&mdash;naturally&mdash;first effort and
all that&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t like middle-aged people tramplin&rsquo; round&mdash;you
see the idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nurse Forbes, who was a bony woman of about forty, saw
the point perfectly, and was very sorry she really could not see
her way to undertaking the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very kind of Miss Murgatroyd,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you
know her well? Such a delightful woman, is she not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expectant father agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Murgatroyd was so very much impressed by your
sympathetic way&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;of nursin&rsquo; that poor old
lady, Miss Dawson, y&rsquo;know. Distant connection of my own as
a matter of fact&mdash;er, yes&mdash;somewhere about fifteenth cousin
twelve times removed. So nervous, wasn&rsquo;t she? A little bit
eccentric, like the rest of the family, but a charming old lady,
don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I became very much attached to her,&rdquo; said Nurse Forbes.
&ldquo;When she was in full possession of her faculties, she was a
most pleasant and thoughtful patient. Of course, she was in
great pain, and we had to keep her under morphia a great part
of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! poor old soul! I sometimes think, Nurse, it&rsquo;s a
great pity we aren&rsquo;t allowed just to help people off, y&rsquo;know,
when they&rsquo;re so far gone. After all, they&rsquo;re practically dead
already, as you might say. What&rsquo;s the point of keepin&rsquo; them
sufferin&rsquo; on like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nurse Forbes looked rather sharply at him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that wouldn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;though one understands
the lay person&rsquo;s point of view, of course. Dr. Carr was
not of your opinion,&rdquo; she added, a little acidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think all that fuss was simply shockin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the gentleman
warmly. &ldquo;Poor old soul! I said to my wife at the time,
why couldn&rsquo;t they let the poor old thing rest. Fancy cuttin&rsquo; her
about, when obviously she&rsquo;d just mercifully gone off in a natural
way! My wife quite agreed with me. She was quite upset
about it, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very distressing to everybody concerned,&rdquo; said Nurse
Forbes, &ldquo;and of course, it put me in a very awkward position.
I ought not to talk about it, but as you are one of the family,
you will quite understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so. Did it ever occur to you, Nurse&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Simms-Gaythorpe
leaned forward, crushing his soft hat between his
hands in a nervous manner&mdash;&ldquo;that there might be something
behind all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nurse Forbes primmed up her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Mr. Simms-Gaythorpe, &ldquo;there <i>have</i> been
cases of doctors tryin&rsquo; to get rich old ladies to make wills in
their favour. You don&rsquo;t think&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nurse Forbes intimated that it was not her business to
think things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not, certainly not. But as man to man&mdash;I
mean, between you and me, what?&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t there a little&mdash;er&mdash;friction,
perhaps, about sending for the solicitor-johnnie,
don&rsquo;t you know? Of course, my Cousin Mary&mdash;I call her cousin,
so to speak, but it&rsquo;s no relation at all really&mdash;of course, I mean,
she&rsquo;s an awfully nice girl and all that sort of thing, but I&rsquo;d got
a sort of idea perhaps she wasn&rsquo;t altogether keen on having the
will-making wallah sent for, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Simms-Gaythorpe, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re quite wrong
there. Miss Whittaker was most anxious that her aunt should
have every facility in that way. In fact&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m betraying
any confidence in telling you this&mdash;she said to me, &lsquo;If
at any time Miss Dawson should express a wish to see a lawyer,
be sure you send for him at once.&rsquo; And so, of course, I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did? And didn&rsquo;t he come, then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly he came. There was no difficulty about it at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! That just shows, doesn&rsquo;t it? how wrong some of
these gossipy females can be! Excuse me, but y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;d got
absolutely the wrong impression about the thing. I&rsquo;m quite <i>sure</i>
Mrs. Peasgood said that no lawyer had been sent for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Mrs. Peasgood could have known
about it,&rdquo; said Nurse Forbes with a sniff, &ldquo;her permission was
not asked in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not&mdash;but you know how these ideas get about.
But, I say&mdash;if there was a will, why wasn&rsquo;t it produced?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that, Mr. Simms-Gaythorpe. There was no
will. The lawyer came to draw up a power of attorney, so that
Miss Whittaker could sign cheques and so on for her aunt.
That was very necessary, you know, on account of the old lady&rsquo;s
failing powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I suppose she was pretty woolly towards the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she was quite sensible when I took over from Nurse
Philliter in September, except, of course, for that fancy she
had about poisoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She really was afraid of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said once or twice, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to die to please
anybody, Nurse.&rsquo; She had great confidence in me. She got on
better with me than with Miss Whittaker, to tell you the truth,
Mr. Simms-Gaythorpe. But during October, her mind began
to give way altogether, and she rambled a lot. She used to wake
up sometimes all in a fright and say, &lsquo;Have they passed it yet,
Nurse?&rsquo;&mdash;just like that. I&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;No, they haven&rsquo;t got that far
yet,&rsquo; and that would quiet her. Thinking of her hunting days,
I expect she was. They often go back like that, you know, when
they&rsquo;re being kept under drugs. Dreaming, like, they are, half
the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then in the last month or so, I suppose she could hardly
have made a will, even if she had wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think she could have managed it then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But earlier on, when the lawyer was there, she could have
done so if she had liked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly she could.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no. I was there with her all the time, at her particular
request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Just you and Miss Whittaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even Miss Whittaker most of the time. I see what
you mean, Mr. Simms-Gaythorpe, but indeed you should clear
your mind of any unkind suspicions of Miss Whittaker. The
lawyer and Miss Dawson and myself were alone together for
nearly an hour, while the clerk drew up the necessary papers
in the next room. It was all done then, you see, because we
thought that a second visit would be too much for Miss Dawson.
Miss Whittaker only came in quite at the end. If Miss
Dawson had wished to make a will, she had ample opportunity
to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; said Mr. Simms-Gaythorpe,
rising to go. &ldquo;These little doubts are so apt to make unpleasantness
in families, don&rsquo;t you know. Well, I must be toddlin&rsquo;
now. I&rsquo;m frightfully sorry you can&rsquo;t come with us, Nurse&mdash;my
wife will be so disappointed. I must try to find somebody else
equally charmin&rsquo; if possible. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter removed his hat in the taxi and scratched his
head thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another good theory gone wrong,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Well,
there&rsquo;s another string to the jolly old bow yet. Cropper first and
then Crofton&mdash;that&rsquo;s the line to take, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">&ldquo;Oh, Miss Evelyn, my dear, oh, poor dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall girl in black started, and looked round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Gulliver&mdash;how very, very kind of you to come
and meet me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And glad I am to have the chance, my dear, all owing
to these kind gentlemen,&rdquo; cried the landlady, flinging her arms
round the girl and clinging to her to the great annoyance of
the other passengers pouring off the gangway. The elder of the
two gentlemen referred to gently put his hand on her arm, and
drew them out of the stream of traffic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor lamb!&rdquo; mourned Mrs. Gulliver, &ldquo;coming all this
way by your lonesome, and poor dear Miss Bertha in her grave
and such terrible things said, and her such a good girl always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s poor Mother I&rsquo;m thinking about,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t rest. I said to my husband, &lsquo;I must go,&rsquo; I said, and he
said, &lsquo;My honey, if I could come with you I would, but I can&rsquo;t
leave the farm, but if you feel you ought to go, you shall,&rsquo; he
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Cropper&mdash;he was always that good and kind,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Gulliver, &ldquo;but here I am, forgittin&rsquo; all about the good
gentlemen as brought me all this way to see you. This is Lord
Peter Wimsey, and this is Mr. Murbles, as put in that unfortnit
advertisement, as I truly believes was the beginin&rsquo; of it all. &rsquo;Ow
I wish I&rsquo;d never showed it to your poor sister, not but wot I
believe the gentleman acted with the best intentions, &rsquo;avin&rsquo;
now seen &rsquo;im, which at first I thought &rsquo;e was a wrong &rsquo;un.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pleased to meet you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cropper, turning with
the ready address derived from service in a big restaurant. &ldquo;Just
before I sailed I got a letter from poor Bertha enclosing your
ad. I couldn&rsquo;t make anything of it, but I&rsquo;d be glad to know
anything which can clear up this shocking business. What have
they said it is&mdash;murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a verdict of natural death at the inquiry,&rdquo; said
Mr. Murbles, &ldquo;but we feel that the case presents some inconsistencies,
and shall be exceedingly grateful for your co-operation
in looking into the matter, and also in connection with
another matter which may or may not have some bearing upon
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cropper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re proper
gentlemen, if Mrs. Gulliver answers for you, for I&rsquo;ve never
known her mistaken in a person yet, have I, Mrs. G? I&rsquo;ll tell
you anything I know, which isn&rsquo;t much, for it&rsquo;s all a horrible
mystery to me. Only I don&rsquo;t want you to delay me, for I&rsquo;ve got
to go straight on down to Mother. She&rsquo;ll be in a dreadful way,
so fond as she was of Bertha, and she&rsquo;s all alone except for the
young girl that looks after her, and that&rsquo;s not much comfort
when you&rsquo;ve lost your daughter so sudden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall not detain you a moment, Mrs. Cropper,&rdquo; said
Mr. Murbles. &ldquo;We propose, if you will allow us, to accompany
you to London, and to ask you a few questions on the way,
and then&mdash;again with your permission&mdash;we should like to see
you safely home to Mrs. Gotobed&rsquo;s house, wherever that may
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christchurch, near Bournemouth,&rdquo; said Lord Peter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
run you down straight away, if you like. It will save time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, you know all about it, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Cropper with some admiration. &ldquo;Well, hadn&rsquo;t we better get a
move on, or we&rsquo;ll miss this train?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles. &ldquo;Allow me to offer you
my arm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Mrs. Cropper approving of this arrangement, the party
made its way to the station, after the usual disembarkation
formalities. As they passed the barrier on to the platform Mrs.
Cropper gave a little exclamation and leaned forward as though
something had caught her eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Mrs. Cropper?&rdquo; said Lord Peter&rsquo;s voice in her
ear. &ldquo;Did you think you recognised somebody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a noticing one, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Mrs. Cropper.
&ldquo;Make a good waiter&mdash;you would&mdash;not meaning any offence,
sir, that&rsquo;s a real compliment from one who knows. Yes, I did
think I saw someone, but it couldn&rsquo;t be, because the minute
she caught my eye she went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did you think it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought it looked like Miss Whittaker, as Bertha
and me used to work for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just down by that pillar there, a tall dark lady in a crimson
hat and grey fur. But she&rsquo;s gone now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter unhitched Mrs. Gulliver from his arm, hitched
her smartly on to the unoccupied arm of Mr. Murbles, and
plunged into the crowd. Mr. Murbles, quite unperturbed by
this eccentric behaviour, shepherded the two women into an
empty first-class carriage which, Mrs. Cropper noted, bore a
large label, &ldquo;Reserved for Lord Peter Wimsey and party.&rdquo; Mrs.
Cropper made some protesting observation about her ticket,
but Mr. Murbles merely replied that everything was provided
for, and that privacy could be more conveniently secured in
this way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend&rsquo;s going to be left behind,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cropper
as the train moved out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be very unlike him,&rdquo; replied Mr. Murbles,
calmly unfolding a couple of rugs and exchanging his old-fashioned
top-hat for a curious kind of travelling cap with flaps
to it. Mrs. Cropper, in the midst of her anxiety, could not help
wondering where in the world he had contrived to purchase
this Victorian relic. As a matter of fact, Mr. Murbles&rsquo; caps
were specially made to his own design by an exceedingly expensive
West End hatter, who held Mr. Murbles in deep respect
as a real gentleman of the old school.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Nothing, however, was seen of Lord Peter for something
like a quarter of an hour, when he suddenly put his head in
with an amiable smile and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One red-haired woman in a crimson hat; three dark women
in black hats; several nondescript women in those pull-on sort
of dust-coloured hats; old women with grey hair, various; sixteen
flappers without hats&mdash;hats on rack, I mean, but none
of &rsquo;em crimson; two obvious brides in blue hats; innumerable
fair women in hats of all colours; one ash-blonde dressed as a
nurse, none of &rsquo;em our friend as far as I know. Thought I&rsquo;d
best just toddle along the train to make sure. There&rsquo;s just one
dark sort of female whose hat I can&rsquo;t see because it&rsquo;s tucked
down beside her. Wonder if Mrs. Cropper would mind doin&rsquo;
a little stagger down the corridor to take a squint at her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Cropper, with some surprise, consented to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are. &rsquo;Splain later. About four carriages along.
Now, look here, Mrs. Cropper, if it <i>should</i> be anybody you
know, I&rsquo;d rather on the whole she didn&rsquo;t spot you watching
her. I want you to walk along behind me, just glancin&rsquo; into
the compartments but keepin&rsquo; your collar turned up. When
we come to the party I have in mind, I&rsquo;ll make a screen for
you, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These man&oelig;uvres were successfully accomplished, Lord
Peter lighting a cigarette opposite the suspected compartment,
while Mrs. Cropper viewed the hatless lady under cover of his
raised elbows. But the result was disappointing. Mrs. Cropper
had never seen the lady before, and a further promenade from
end to end of the train produced no better results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must leave it to Bunter, then,&rdquo; said his lordship,
cheerfully, as they returned to their seats. &ldquo;I put him on the
trail as soon as you gave me the good word. Now, Mrs. Cropper,
we really get down to business. First of all, we should be glad
of any suggestions you may have to make about your sister&rsquo;s
death. We don&rsquo;t want to distress you, but we have got an idea
that there might, just possibly, be something behind it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one thing, sir&mdash;your lordship, I suppose I
should say. Bertha was a real good girl&mdash;I can answer for that
absolutely. There wouldn&rsquo;t have been any carryings-on with
her young man&mdash;nothing of that. I know people have been
saying all sorts of things, and perhaps, with lots of girls as they
are, it isn&rsquo;t to be wondered at. But, believe me, Bertha wouldn&rsquo;t
go for to do anything that wasn&rsquo;t right. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to
see this last letter she wrote me. I&rsquo;m sure nothing could be
nicer and properer from a girl just looking forward to a happy
marriage. Now, a girl as wrote like that wouldn&rsquo;t be going
larking about, sir, would she? I couldn&rsquo;t rest, thinking they was
saying that about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter took the letter, glanced through it, and handed
it reverently to Mr. Murbles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not thinking that at all, Mrs. Cropper, though of
course we&rsquo;re very glad to have your point of view, don&rsquo;t you
see. Now, do you think it possible your sister might have been&mdash;what
shall I say?&mdash;got hold of by some woman with a plausible
story and all that, and&mdash;well&mdash;pushed into some position which
shocked her very much? Was she cautious and up to the tricks
of London people and all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he outlined Parker&rsquo;s theory of the engaging Mrs. Forrest
and the supposed dinner in the flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my lord, I wouldn&rsquo;t say Bertha was a very quick
girl&mdash;not as quick as me, you know. She&rsquo;d always be ready to
believe what she was told and give people credit for the best.
Took more after her father, like. I&rsquo;m Mother&rsquo;s girl, they always
said, and I don&rsquo;t trust anybody further than I can see them.
But I&rsquo;d warned her very careful against taking up with women
as talks to a girl in the street, and she did ought to have been
on her guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;it may have been somebody she&rsquo;d
got to know quite well&mdash;say, at the restaurant, and she thought
she was a nice lady and there&rsquo;d be no harm in going to see
her. Or the lady might have suggested taking her into good
service. One never knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;d have mentioned it in her letters if she&rsquo;d
talked to the lady much, my lord. It&rsquo;s wonderful what a lot of
things she&rsquo;d find to tell me about the customers. And I don&rsquo;t
think she&rsquo;d be for going into service again. We got real fed up
with service, down in Leahampton.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. Now that brings us to quite a different point&mdash;the
thing we wanted to ask you or your sister about before this
sad accident took place. You were in service with this Miss
Whittaker whom you mentioned just now. I wonder if you&rsquo;d
mind telling us just exactly why you left. It was a good place,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord, quite a good place as places go, though of
course a girl doesn&rsquo;t get her freedom the way she does in a
restaurant. And naturally there was a good deal of waiting on
the old lady. Not as we minded that, for she was a very kind,
good lady, and generous too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when she became so ill, I suppose Miss Whittaker
managed everything, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord; but it wasn&rsquo;t a hard place&mdash;lots of the girls
envied us. Only Miss Whittaker was very particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially about the china, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, they told you about that, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told &rsquo;em, dearie,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Gulliver. &ldquo;I told &rsquo;em all
about how you come to leave your place and go to London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it struck us,&rdquo; put in Mr. Murbles, &ldquo;that it was, shall
we say, somewhat rash of Miss Whittaker to dismiss so competent
and, if I may put it so, so well-spoken and personable
a pair of maids on so trivial a pretext.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there, sir. Bertha&mdash;I told you she was the
trusting one&mdash;she was quite ready to believe as she done wrong,
and thought how good it was of Miss Whittaker to forgive her
breaking the china, and take so much interest in sending us
to London, but I always thought there was something more
than met the eye. Didn&rsquo;t I, Mrs. Gulliver?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you did, dear; something more than meets the eye,
that&rsquo;s what you says to me, and what I agrees with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you, in your own mind,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Murbles,
&ldquo;connect this sudden dismissal with anything which had taken
place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I did then,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Cropper, with some spirit.
&ldquo;I said to Bertha&mdash;but she would hear nothing of it, taking
after her father as I tell you&mdash;I said, &lsquo;Mark my words,&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;Miss Whittaker don&rsquo;t care to have us in the house after the
row she had with the old lady.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what row was that?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Murbles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know as I ought rightly to tell you about it,
seeing it&rsquo;s all over now and we promised to say nothing about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, of course,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles, checking Lord Peter,
who was about to burst in impetuously, &ldquo;depends upon your
own conscience. But, if it will be of any help to you in making
up your mind, I think I may say, in the strictest confidence,
that this information may be of the utmost importance to us&mdash;in
a roundabout way which I won&rsquo;t trouble you with&mdash;in
investigating a very singular set of circumstances which have
been brought to our notice. And it is just barely possible&mdash;again
in a very roundabout way&mdash;that it may assist us in throwing
some light on the melancholy tragedy of your sister&rsquo;s decease.
Further than that I cannot go at the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cropper, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s so&mdash;though,
mind you, I don&rsquo;t see what connection there could be&mdash;but
if you think that&rsquo;s so, I reckon I&rsquo;d better come across with it,
as my husband would say. After all, I only promised I wouldn&rsquo;t
mention about it to the people in Leahampton, as might have
made mischief out of it&mdash;and a gossipy lot they is, and no
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve nothing to do with the Leahampton crowd,&rdquo; said
his lordship, &ldquo;and it won&rsquo;t be passed along unless it turns out
to be necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto. Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you. One morning early in September
Miss Whittaker comes along to Bertha and I, and says,
&lsquo;I want you girls to be just handy on the landing outside Miss
Dawson&rsquo;s bedroom,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;because I may want you to come
in and witness her signature to a document. We shall want two
witnesses,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;and you&rsquo;ll have to see her sign; but I don&rsquo;t
want to flurry her with a lot of people in the room, so when
I give you the tip, I want you to come just inside the door
without making a noise, so that you can see her write her
name, and then I&rsquo;ll bring it straight across to you and you can
write your names where I show you. It&rsquo;s quite easy,&rsquo; she says,
&lsquo;nothing to do but just put your names opposite where you see
the word Witnesses.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bertha was always a bit the timid sort&mdash;afraid of documents
and that sort of thing, and she tried to get out of it.
&lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t Nurse sign instead of me?&rsquo; she says. That was Nurse
Philliter, you know, the red-haired one as was the doctor&rsquo;s
fianc&eacute;e. She was a very nice woman, and we liked her quite
a lot. &lsquo;Nurse has gone out for her walk,&rsquo; says Miss Whittaker,
rather sharp, &lsquo;I want you and Evelyn to do it,&rsquo; meaning me,
of course. Well, we said we didn&rsquo;t mind, and Miss Whittaker
goes upstairs to Miss Dawson with a whole heap of papers, and
Bertha and I followed and waited on the landing, like she said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles, &ldquo;did Miss Dawson
often have documents to sign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I believe so, quite frequently, but they was usually
witnessed by Miss Whittaker or the nurse. There was some
leases and things of that sort, or so I heard. Miss Dawson had
a little house-property. And then there&rsquo;d be the cheques for the
housekeeping, and some papers as used to come from the Bank,
and be put away in the safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Share coupons and so on, I suppose,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely, sir, I don&rsquo;t know much about those business
matters. I did have to witness a signature once, I remember,
a long time back, but that was different. The paper was brought
down to me with the signature ready wrote. There wasn&rsquo;t any
of this to-do about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old lady was capable of dealing with her own affairs,
I understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up till then, sir. Afterwards, as I understood, she made
it all over to Miss Whittaker&mdash;that was just before she got
feeble-like, and was kept under drugs. Miss Whittaker signed
the cheques then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The power of attorney,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles, with a nod.
&ldquo;Well now, did you sign this mysterious paper?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I&rsquo;ll tell you how that was. When me and Bertha
had been waiting a little time, Miss Whittaker comes to the
door and makes us a sign to come in quiet. So we comes and
stands just inside the door. There was a screen by the head of
the bed, so we couldn&rsquo;t see Miss Dawson nor she us, but we
could see her reflection quite well in a big looking-glass she
had on the left side of the bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Murbles exchanged a significant glance with Lord
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now be sure you tell us every detail,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;no
matter how small and silly it may sound. I believe this is goin&rsquo;
to be very excitin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord. Well, there wasn&rsquo;t much else, except that
just inside the door, on the left-hand side as you went in, there
was a little table, where Nurse mostly used to set down trays
and things that had to go down, and it was cleared, and a piece
of blotting-paper on it and an inkstand and pen, all ready for
us to sign with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could Miss Dawson see that?&rdquo; asked Mr. Murbles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, because of the screen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was inside the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to be quite clear about this. Do you think you
could draw&mdash;quite roughly&mdash;a little plan of the room, showing
where the bed was and the screen and the mirror, and so on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much of a hand at drawing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cropper
dubiously, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Murbles produced a notebook and fountain pen, and
after a few false starts, the following rough sketch was produced.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="Miss Dawson&rsquo;s bedroom" width="500" height="553" >
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, that is very clear indeed. You notice, Lord
Peter, the careful arrangements to have the document signed
in presence of the witnesses, and witnessed by them in the
presence of Miss Dawson and of each other. I needn&rsquo;t tell you
for what kind of document that arrangement is indispensable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that it, sir? We couldn&rsquo;t understand why it was all
arranged like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have happened,&rdquo; explained Mr. Murbles, &ldquo;that
in case of some dispute about this document, you and your
sister would have had to come into court and give evidence
about it. And if so, you would have been asked whether you
actually saw Miss Dawson write her signature, and whether
you and your sister and Miss Dawson were all in the same
room together when you signed your names as witnesses. And
if that had happened, you could have said yes, couldn&rsquo;t you,
and sworn to it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, actually, Miss Dawson would have known nothing
about your being there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was it, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see now, sir, but at the time Bertha and me couldn&rsquo;t
make nothing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the document, you say, was never signed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. At any rate, we never witnessed anything. We
saw Miss Dawson write her name&mdash;at least, I suppose it was
her name&mdash;to one or two papers, and then Miss Whittaker
puts another lot in front of her and says, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s another little
lot, auntie, some more of those income-tax forms.&rsquo; So the old
lady says, &lsquo;What are they exactly, dear, let me see?&rsquo; So Miss
Whittaker says, &lsquo;Oh, only the usual things.&rsquo; And Miss Dawson
says, &lsquo;Dear, dear, what a lot of them. How complicated they
do make these things to be sure.&rsquo; And we could see that Miss
Whittaker was giving her several papers, all laid on top of one
another, with just the places for the signatures left showing.
So Miss Dawson signs the top one, and then lifts up the paper
and looks underneath at the next one, and Miss Whittaker says,
&lsquo;They&rsquo;re all the same,&rsquo; as if she was in a hurry to get them
signed and done with. But Miss Dawson takes them out of her
hand and starts looking through them, and suddenly she lets
out a screech, and says, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t have it, I won&rsquo;t have it! I&rsquo;m
not dying yet. How dare you, you wicked girl! Can&rsquo;t you wait
till I&rsquo;m dead?&mdash;you want to frighten me into my grave before
my time. Haven&rsquo;t you got everything you want?&rsquo; And Miss
Whittaker says, &lsquo;Hush, auntie, you won&rsquo;t let me explain&mdash;&rsquo;
and the old lady says, &lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t want to hear anything
about it. I hate the thought of it. I won&rsquo;t talk about it. You
leave me be. I can&rsquo;t get better if you keep frightening me so.&rsquo;
And then she begins to take and carry on dreadful, and Miss
Whittaker comes over to us looking awful white and says, &lsquo;Run
along, you girls,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;my aunt&rsquo;s taken ill and can&rsquo;t attend
to business. I&rsquo;ll call you if I want you,&rsquo; she says. And I said,
&lsquo;Can we help with her, miss?&rsquo; and she says, &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s quite all
right. It&rsquo;s just the pain come on again. I&rsquo;ll give her her injection
and then she&rsquo;ll be all right.&rsquo; And she pushes us out of the room,
and shuts the door, and we heard the poor old lady crying fit
to break anybody&rsquo;s heart. So we went downstairs and met Nurse
just coming in, and we told her Miss Dawson was took worse
again, and she runs up quick without taking her things off. So
we was in the kitchen, just saying it seemed rather funny-like,
when Miss Whittaker comes down again and says, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right
now, and auntie&rsquo;s sleeping quite peaceful, only we&rsquo;ll have to
put off business till another day.&rsquo; And she says, &lsquo;Better not say
anything about this to anybody, because when the pain comes
on Aunt gets frightened and talks a bit wild. She don&rsquo;t mean
what she says, but if people was to hear about it they might
think it odd.&rsquo; So I up and says, &lsquo;Miss Whittaker,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;me
and Bertha was never ones to talk&rsquo;; rather stiff, I said it, because
I don&rsquo;t hold by gossip and never did. And Miss Whittaker says,
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s quite all right,&rsquo; and goes away. And the next day she
gives us an afternoon off and a present&mdash;ten shillings each, it
was, because it was her aunt&rsquo;s birthday, and the old lady wanted
us to have a little treat in her honour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;A very clear account indeed, Mrs. Cropper, and I only
wish all witnesses were as sensible and observant as you are.
There&rsquo;s just one thing. Did you by any chance get a sight of
this paper that upset Miss Dawson so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir&mdash;only from a distance, that is, and in the looking-glass.
But I think it was quite short&mdash;just a few lines of typewriting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Was there a typewriter in the house, by the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir. Miss Whittaker used one quite often for
business letters and so on. It used to stand in the sitting-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so. By the way, do you remember Miss Dawson&rsquo;s
solicitor calling shortly after this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. It was only a little time later Bertha broke the
teapot and we left. Miss Whittaker gave her her month&rsquo;s warning,
but I said no. If she could come down on a girl like that
for a little thing, and her such a good worker, Bertha should
go at once and me with her. Miss Whittaker said, &lsquo;Just as you
like,&rsquo; she said&mdash;she never was one to stand any back-chat. So
we went that afternoon. But afterwards I think she was sorry,
and came over to see us at Christchurch, and suggested why
shouldn&rsquo;t we try for a better job in London. Bertha was a bit
afraid to go so far&mdash;taking after Father, as I mentioned, but
Mother, as was always the ambitious one, she says, &lsquo;If the lady&rsquo;s
kind enough to give you a good start, why not go? There&rsquo;s more
chances for a girl in Town.&rsquo; And I said to Bertha, private-like,
afterwards, I says, &lsquo;Depend on it, Miss Whittaker wants to see
the back of us. She&rsquo;s afraid we&rsquo;ll get talking about the things
Miss Dawson said that morning. But,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;if she&rsquo;s willing
to pay us to go, why not go,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;A girl&rsquo;s got to look out for
herself these days, and if we go off to London she&rsquo;ll give us a
better character than what she would if we stayed. And anyway,&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;if we don&rsquo;t like it we can always come home again.&rsquo; So
the long and short was, we came to Town, and after a bit we
got good jobs with Lyons, what with the good character Miss
Whittaker gave us, and I met my husband there and Bertha
met her Jim. So we never regretted having taken the chance&mdash;not
till this dreadful thing happened to Bertha.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The passionate interest with which her hearers had received
this recital must have gratified Mrs. Cropper&rsquo;s sense of
the dramatic. Mr. Murbles was very slowly rotating his hands
over one another with a dry, rustling sound&mdash;like an old snake,
gliding through the long grass in search of prey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little scene after your own heart, Murbles,&rdquo; said Lord
Peter, with a glint under his dropped eyelids. He turned again
to Mrs. Cropper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first time you&rsquo;ve told this story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and I wouldn&rsquo;t have said anything if it hadn&rsquo;t
been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Now, if you&rsquo;ll take my advice, Mrs. Cropper, you
won&rsquo;t tell it again. Stories like that have a nasty way of bein&rsquo;
dangerous. Will you consider it an impertinence if I ask you
what your plans are for the next week or two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see Mother and get her to come back to
Canada with me. I wanted her to come when I got married,
but she didn&rsquo;t like going so far away from Bertha. She was
always Mother&rsquo;s favourite&mdash;taking so much after Father, you
see. Mother and me was always too much alike to get on. But
now she&rsquo;s got nobody else, and it isn&rsquo;t right for her to be all
alone, so I think she&rsquo;ll come with me. It&rsquo;s a long journey for
an ailing old woman, but I reckon blood&rsquo;s thicker than water.
My husband said, &lsquo;Bring her back first-class, my girl, and I&rsquo;ll
find the money.&rsquo; He&rsquo;s a good sort, is my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t do better,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;and if you&rsquo;ll allow
me, I&rsquo;ll send a friend to look after you both on the train journey
and see you safe on to the boat. And don&rsquo;t stop long in England.
Excuse me buttin&rsquo; in on your affairs like this, but honestly I
think you&rsquo;d be safer elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that Bertha&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes widened with alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to say quite what I think, because I don&rsquo;t
know. But I&rsquo;ll see you and your mother are safe, whatever
happens.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Bertha? Can I do anything about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to come and see my friends at Scotland
Yard, I think, and tell them what you&rsquo;ve told me. They&rsquo;ll be
interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will something be done about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, if we can prove there&rsquo;s been any foul play, the
police won&rsquo;t rest till it&rsquo;s been tracked down to the right person.
But the difficulty is, you see, to prove that the death wasn&rsquo;t
natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I observe in to-day&rsquo;s paper,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles, &ldquo;that the
local superintendent is now satisfied that Miss Gotobed came
down alone for a quiet picnic and died of a heart attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man would say anything,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;We know
from the post-mortem that she had recently had a heavy meal&mdash;forgive
these distressin&rsquo; details, Mrs. Cropper&rsquo;&mdash;so why the
picnic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they had the sandwiches and the beer-bottle in
mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles, mildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. I suppose she went down to Epping alone with a
bottle of Bass and took out the cork with her fingers. Ever tried
doing it, Murbles? No? Well, when they find the corkscrew
I&rsquo;ll believe she went there alone. In the meantime, I hope the
papers will publish a few more theories like that. Nothin&rsquo; like
inspiring criminals with confidence, Murbles&mdash;it goes to their
heads, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">Lord Peter took Mrs. Cropper down to Christchurch and returned
to town to have a conference with Mr. Parker. The
latter had just listened to his recital of Mrs. Cropper&rsquo;s story,
when the discreet opening and closing of the flat-door announced
the return of Bunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo; inquired Wimsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret exceedingly to have to inform your lordship that
I lost track of the lady. In fact, if your lordship will kindly
excuse the expression, I was completely done in the eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God, Bunter, you&rsquo;re human after all. I didn&rsquo;t know
anybody could do you. Have a drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am much obliged to your lordship. According to instructions,
I searched the platform for a lady in a crimson hat
and a grey fur, and at length was fortunate enough to observe
her making her way out by the station entrance towards the
big bookstall. She was some way ahead of me, but the hat was
very conspicuous, and, in the words of the poet, if I may so
express myself, I followed the gleam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stout fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my lord. The lady walked into the Station
Hotel, which, as you know, has two entrances, one upon the
platform, and the other upon the street. I hurried after her for
fear she should give me the slip, and made my way through
the revolving doors just in time to see her back disappearing
into the Ladies&rsquo; Retiring Room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whither, as a modest man, you could not follow her. I
quite understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, my lord. I took a seat in the entrance hall, in
a position from which I could watch the door without appearing
to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And discovered too late that the place had two exits, I
suppose. Unusual and distressin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord. That was not the trouble. I sat watching
for three quarters of an hour, but the crimson hat did not
reappear. Your lordship will bear in mind that I had never seen
the lady&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I foresee the end of this story, Bunter. Not your fault.
Proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of this time, my lord, I felt bound to conclude
either that the lady had been taken ill or that something untoward
had occurred. I summoned a female attendant who
happened to cross the hall and informed her that I had been
entrusted with a message for a lady whose dress I described. I
begged her to ascertain from the attendant in the Ladies&rsquo; Room
whether the lady in question was still there. The girl went away
and presently returned to say that the lady had changed her
costume in the cloak-room and had gone out half an hour
previously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bunter, Bunter. Didn&rsquo;t you spot the suitcase or whatever
it was when she came out again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, my lord. The lady had come in earlier in
the day and had left an attach&eacute;-case in charge of the attendant.
On returning, she had transferred her hat and fur to the attach&eacute;-case
and put on a small black felt hat and a light-weight raincoat
which she had packed there in readiness. So that her dress was
concealed when she emerged and she was carrying the attach&eacute;-case,
whereas, when I first saw her, she had been empty-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything foreseen. What a woman!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;I made immediate inquiries, my lord, in the region of
the hotel and the station, but without result. The black hat
and raincoat were entirely inconspicuous, and no one remembered
having seen her. I went to the Central Station to discover
if she had travelled by any train. Several women answering to
the description had taken tickets for various destinations, but
I could get no definite information. I also visited all the garages
in Liverpool, with the same lack of success. I am greatly distressed
to have failed your lordship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped. You did everything you could do. Cheer
up. Never say die. And you must be tired to death. Take the
day off and go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank your lordship, but I slept excellently in the train
on the way up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you like, Bunter. But I did hope you sometimes
got tired like other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bunter smiled discreetly and withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve gained this much, anyhow,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;We
know now that this Miss Whittaker has something to conceal,
since she takes such precautions to avoid being followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know more than that. We know that she was desperately
anxious to get hold of the Cropper woman before
anybody else could see her, no doubt to stop her mouth by
bribery or by worse means. By the way, how did she know she
was coming by that boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Cropper sent a cable, which was read at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn these inquests. They give away all the information
one wants kept quiet, and produce no evidence worth having.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; said Parker, with emphasis, &ldquo;not to mention
that we had to sit through a lot of moral punk by the Coroner,
about the prevalence of jazz and the immoral behaviour of
modern girls in going off alone with young men to Epping
Forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity these busy-bodies can&rsquo;t be had up for libel.
Never mind. We&rsquo;ll get the Whittaker woman yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always provided it was the Whittaker woman. After all,
Mrs. Cropper may have been mistaken. Lots of people do
change their hats in cloak-rooms without any criminal intentions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. Miss Whittaker&rsquo;s supposed to be in the
country with Miss Findlater, isn&rsquo;t she? We&rsquo;ll get the invaluable
Miss Climpson to pump the girl when they turn up again.
Meanwhile, what do you think of Mrs. Cropper&rsquo;s story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about what happened there. Miss Whittaker
was trying to get the old lady to sign a will without knowing
it. She gave it to her all mixed up with the income-tax papers,
hoping she&rsquo;d put her name to it without reading it. It must
have been a will, I think, because that&rsquo;s the only document I
know of which is invalid unless it&rsquo;s witnessed by two persons
in the presence of the testatrix and of each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. And since Miss Whittaker couldn&rsquo;t be one of the
witnesses herself, but had to get the two maids to sign, the will
must have been in Miss Whittaker&rsquo;s favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously. She wouldn&rsquo;t go to all that trouble to disinherit
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that brings us to another difficulty. Miss Whittaker,
as next of kin, would have taken all the old lady had to leave
in any case. As a matter of fact, she did. Why bother about a
will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, as we said before, she was afraid Miss Dawson
would change her mind, and wanted to get a will made out
before&mdash;no, that won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;because, anyhow, any will made later would invalidate
the first will. Besides, the old lady sent for her solicitor
some time later, and Miss Whittaker put no obstacle of any
kind in her way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to Nurse Forbes, she was particularly anxious
that every facility should be given.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing how Miss Dawson distrusted her niece, it&rsquo;s a bit
surprising, really, that she didn&rsquo;t will the money away. Then
it would have been to Miss Whittaker&rsquo;s advantage to keep her
alive as long as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose she really distrusted her&mdash;not to the extent
of expecting to be made away with. She was excited and said
more than she meant&mdash;we often do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but she evidently thought there&rsquo;d be other attempts
to get a will signed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember the power of attorney? The old girl
evidently thought that out and decided to give Miss Whittaker
authority to sign everything for her so that there couldn&rsquo;t possibly
be any jiggery-pokery about papers in future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Cute old lady. How very irritating for Miss
Whittaker. And after that very hopeful visit of the solicitor,
too. So disappointing. Instead of the expected will, a very
carefully planted spoke in her wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But we&rsquo;re still brought up against the problem, why
a will at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men pulled at their pipes for some time in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The aunt evidently intended the money to go to Mary
Whittaker all right,&rdquo; remarked Parker at last. &ldquo;She promised it
so often&mdash;besides, I daresay she was a just-minded old thing,
and remembered that it was really Whittaker money which had
come to her over the head of the Rev. Charles, or whatever
his name was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. Well, there&rsquo;s only one thing that could prevent
that happening, and that&rsquo;s&mdash;oh, lord! old son. Do you know
what it works out at? The old, old story, beloved of novelists&mdash;the
missing heir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good lord, yes, you&rsquo;re right. Damn it all, what fools we
were not to think of it before. Mary Whittaker possibly found
out that there was some nearer relative left, who would scoop
the lot. Maybe she was afraid that if Miss Dawson got to know
about it, she&rsquo;d divide the money or disinherit Mary altogether.
Or perhaps she just despaired of hammering the story into the
old lady&rsquo;s head, and so hit on the idea of getting her to make
the will unbeknownst to herself in Mary&rsquo;s favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a brain you&rsquo;ve got, Charles. Or, see here, Miss
Dawson may have known all about it, sly old thing, and determined
to pay Miss Whittaker out for her indecent urgency
in the matter of will-makin&rsquo; by just dyin&rsquo; intestate in the other
chappie&rsquo;s favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she did, she deserved anything she got,&rdquo; said Parker,
rather viciously. &ldquo;After taking the poor girl away from her job
under promise of leaving her the dibs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Teach the young woman not to be so mercenary,&rdquo; retorted
Wimsey, with the cheerful brutality of the man who has never
in his life been short of money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this bright idea is correct,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;it rather messes
up your murder theory, doesn&rsquo;t it? Because Mary would obviously
take the line of keeping her aunt alive as long as possible,
in hopes she might make a will after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Curse you, Charles, I see that bet of mine
going west. What a blow for friend Carr, too. I did hope I was
going to vindicate him and have him played home by the village
band under a triumphal arch with &lsquo;Welcome, Champion of
Truth!&rsquo; picked out in red-white-and-blue electric bulbs. Never
mind. It&rsquo;s better to lose a wager and see the light than walk in
ignorance bloated with gold.&mdash;Or stop!&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t Carr
be right after all? Perhaps it&rsquo;s just my choice of a murderer
that&rsquo;s wrong. Aha! I see a new and even more sinister villain
step upon the scene. The new claimant, warned by his minions&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What minions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be so pernickety, Charles. Nurse Forbes, probably.
I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if she&rsquo;s in his pay. Where was I? I
wish you wouldn&rsquo;t interrupt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warned by his minions&mdash;&rdquo; prompted Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;warned by his minions that Miss Dawson is
hob-nobbing with solicitors and being tempted into making
wills and things, gets the said minions to polish her off before
she can do any mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by one of those native poisons which slay in a split
second and defy the skill of the analyst. They are familiar to
the meanest writer of mystery stories. I&rsquo;m not going to let a
trifle like that stand in my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why hasn&rsquo;t this hypothetical gentleman brought forward
any claim to the property so far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s biding his time. The fuss about the death scared
him, and he&rsquo;s lying low till it&rsquo;s all blown over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll find it much more awkward to dispossess Miss Whittaker
now she&rsquo;s taken possession. Possession is nine points of
the law, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but he&rsquo;s going to pretend he wasn&rsquo;t anywhere
near at the time of Miss Dawson&rsquo;s death. He only read about
it a few weeks ago in a sheet of newspaper wrapped round a
salmon-tin, and now he&rsquo;s rushing home from his distant farm
in thing-ma-jig to proclaim himself as the long-lost Cousin
Tom.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Great Scott! that reminds me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He plunged his hand into his pocket and pulled out a
letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This came this morning just as I was going out, and I
met Freddy Arbuthnot on the doorstep and shoved it into my
pocket before I&rsquo;d read it properly. But I do believe there was
something in it about a Cousin Somebody from some god-forsaken
spot. Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unfolded the letter, which was written in Miss Climpson&rsquo;s
old-fashioned flowing hand, and ornamented with such
a variety of underlinings and exclamation marks as to look like
an exercise in musical notation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, lord!&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s worse than usual, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;it must be of desperate
importance. Luckily it&rsquo;s comparatively short.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">My dear Lord Peter,</span></p>
<p>I heard something this morning which <span class="small">MAY</span> be of <i>use, so</i>
I <span class="small">HASTEN</span> to communicate it!! You remember I <i>mentioned
before</i> that Mrs. Budge&rsquo;s <i>maid</i> is the <span class="small">SISTER</span> of the <i>present</i> maid
at Miss <i>Whittaker&rsquo;s</i>? <span class="sc">Well!!!</span> The <span class="small">AUNT</span> of these two girls came
to <i>pay a visit</i> to Mrs. Budge&rsquo;s girl this afternoon, and was
<i>introduced to me</i>&mdash;of course, as <i>boarder</i> at Mrs. Budge&rsquo;s I am
naturally an <i>object of local interest</i>&mdash;and, bearing <i>your instructions</i>
in mind, I <i>encourage</i> this to an extent I should not otherwise
do!!</p>
<p>It appears that this <i>aunt</i> was well acquainted with a <i>former
housekeeper</i> of Miss Dawson&rsquo;s&mdash;<i>before</i> the time of the Gotobed
girls, I mean. The <i>aunt</i> is a highly <i>respectable</i> person of <span class="small">FORBIDDING
ASPECT</span>!&mdash;with a <i>bonnet</i>(!) and to my mind, a most
<i>disagreeable</i> <span class="small">CENSORIOUS</span> woman. However!&mdash;We got to speaking
of Miss Dawson&rsquo;s death, and this aunt&mdash;her name is Timmins&mdash;<i>primmed</i>
up her mouth and said: &ldquo;No unpleasant scandal
would surprise me about <i>that</i> family, Miss Climpson. They
were <i>most</i> <span class="small">UNDESIRABLY</span> connected! You recollect, Mrs. Budge,
that I felt <i>obliged to leave</i> after the appearance of that <i>most</i>
<span class="small">EXTRAORDINARY</span> person who announced himself as Miss Dawson&rsquo;s
cousin.&rdquo; Naturally, I asked <i>who</i> this <i>might be</i>, not having
heard of any <i>other relations</i>! She said that this person, whom
she described as a <i>nasty</i>, <span class="small">DIRTY</span> NIGGER(!!!) arrived one
morning, dressed up as a <span class="small">CLERGYMAN</span>!!!&mdash;and sent her&mdash;Miss
Timmins&mdash;to announce him to Miss Dawson as her <span class="sc">Cousin
Hallelujah</span>!!! Miss Timmins showed him up, <i>much against
her will</i>, she said, into the <i>nice</i>, <span class="small">CLEAN</span>, drawing-room! Miss
Dawson, she said, actually <i>came down</i> to see this &ldquo;creature&rdquo;
instead of sending him about his &ldquo;black business&rdquo;(!), and as a
<i>crowning scandal</i>, asked him to <i>stay to lunch</i>!&mdash;&ldquo;with her niece
there, too,&rdquo; Miss Timmins said, &ldquo;and this horrible <i>blackamoor</i>
<span class="small">ROLLING</span> his dreadful eyes at her.&rdquo; Miss Timmins said that it
&ldquo;regularly turned her stomach&rdquo;&mdash;that was her phrase, and I
trust you will excuse it&mdash;I understand that these <i>parts of the
body</i> are frequently referred to in polite(!) society nowadays.
In fact, it appears she <i>refused to cook the lunch</i> for the poor
black man&mdash;(after all, even <i>blacks</i> are God&rsquo;s <i>creatures</i> and we
might <i>all</i> be <i>black</i> <span class="small">OURSELVES</span> if He had not in His infinite
kindness seen fit to <i>favour us</i> with <i>white</i> skins!!)&mdash;and walked
straight out of the house!!! So that unfortunately she cannot
tell us anything <i>further</i> about this <i>remarkable</i> incident! She is
<i>certain</i>, however, that the &ldquo;nigger&rdquo; had a <i>visiting-card</i>, with
the name &ldquo;Rev. H. Dawson&rdquo; upon it, and an address in foreign
parts. It does seem <i>strange</i>, does it not, but I believe many of
these <i>native preachers</i> are called to do <i>splendid work</i> among
their own people, and no doubt a <i>MINISTER</i> is entitled to have
<i>visiting-card</i>, even when black!!!</p>
<p><span class="center">In great haste,</span>
<span class="center"><span class="hst">Sincerely yours,</span></span>
<span class="jr">A. K. <span class="sc">Climpson</span>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul,&rdquo; said Lord Peter, when he had disentangled
this screed&mdash;&ldquo;here&rsquo;s our claimant ready made.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;With a hide as black as his heart, apparently,&rdquo; replied
Parker. &ldquo;I wonder where the Rev. Hallelujah has got to&mdash;and
where he came from. He&mdash;er&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t be in &lsquo;Crockford,&rsquo;
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would be, probably, if he&rsquo;s Church of England,&rdquo; said
Lord Peter, dubiously, going in search of that valuable work of
reference. &ldquo;Dawson&mdash;Rev. George, Rev. Gordon, Rev. Gurney,
Rev. Habbakuk, Rev. Hadrian, Rev. Hammond&mdash;no,
there&rsquo;s no Rev. Hallelujah. I was afraid the name hadn&rsquo;t altogether
an established sound. It would be easier if we had an
idea what part of the world the gentleman came from. &lsquo;Nigger,&rsquo;
to a Miss Timmins, may mean anything from a high-caste
Brahmin to Sambo and Raustus at the Coliseum&mdash;it may even,
at a pinch, be an Argentine or an Esquimaux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose other religious bodies have their Crockfords,&rdquo;
suggested Parker, a little hopelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, no doubt&mdash;except perhaps the more exclusive sects&mdash;like
the Agapemonites and those people who gather together
to say OM. Was it Voltaire who said that the English had three
hundred and sixty-five religions and only one sauce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judging from the War Tribunals,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;I should
say that was an under-statement. And then there&rsquo;s America&mdash;a
country, I understand, remarkably well supplied with religions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too true. Hunting for a single dog-collar in the States
must be like the proverbial needle. Still, we could make a few
discreet inquiries, and meanwhile I&rsquo;m going to totter up to
Crofton with the jolly old &rsquo;bus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crofton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where Miss Clara Whittaker and Miss Dawson used to
live. I&rsquo;m going to look for the man with the little black bag&mdash;the
strange, suspicious solicitor, you remember, who came to
see Miss Dawson two years ago, and was so anxious that she
should make a will. I fancy he knows all there is to know about
the Rev. Hallelujah and his claim. Will you come too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t&mdash;not without special permission. I&rsquo;m not officially
on this case, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on the Gotobed business. Tell the Chief you think
they&rsquo;re connected. I shall need your restraining presence. No
less ignoble pressure than that of the regular police force will
induce a smoke-dried family lawyer to spill the beans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll try&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll promise to drive with reasonable
precaution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be thou as chaste as ice and have a license as pure as
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. I am <i>not</i> a dangerous
driver. Buck up and get your leave. The snow-white horsepower
foams and frets and the blue bonnet&mdash;black in this case&mdash;is
already, in a manner of speaking, over the border.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll drive me over the border one of these days,&rdquo; grumbled
Parker, and went to the &rsquo;phone to call up Sir Andrew
Mackenzie at Scotland Yard.</p>
<p class="tb">Crofton is a delightful little old-world village tucked away
amid the maze of criss-cross country roads which fills the triangle
of which Coventry, Warwick and Birmingham mark the
angles. Through the falling night, &ldquo;Mrs. Merdle&rdquo; purred her
way delicately round hedge-blinded corners and down devious
lanes, her quest made no easier by the fact that the Warwick
County Council had pitched upon that particular week for a
grand repainting of signposts and had reached the preliminary
stage of laying a couple of thick coats of gleaming white paint
over all the lettering. At intervals the patient Bunter unpacked
himself from the back seat and climbed one of these uncommunicative
guides to peer at its blank surface with a torch&mdash;a
process which reminded Parker of Alan Quartermain trying
to trace the features of the departed Kings of the Kukuanas
under their calcareous shrouds of stalactite. One of the posts
turned out to be in the wet-paint stage, which added to the
depression of the party. Finally, after several misdirections,
blind alleys, and reversings back to the main road, they came
to a fourways. The signpost here must have been in extra need
of repairs, for its arms had been removed bodily; it stood, stark
and ghastly&mdash;a long, livid finger erected in wild protest to the
unsympathetic heavens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s starting to rain,&rdquo; observed Parker, conversationally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Charles, if you&rsquo;re going to bear up cheerfully
and be the life and soul of the expedition, say so and have
done with it. I&rsquo;ve got a good, heavy spanner handy under the
seat, and Bunter can help to bury the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think this must be Brushwood Cross,&rdquo; resumed Parker,
who had the map on his knee. &ldquo;If so, and if it&rsquo;s not Covert
Corner, which I thought we passed half an hour ago, one of
those roads leads directly to Crofton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be highly encouraging if we only knew which
road we were on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can always try them in turn, and come back if we
find we&rsquo;re going wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They bury <i>suicides</i> at cross-roads,&rdquo; replied Wimsey, dangerously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man sitting under that tree,&rdquo; pursued Parker.
&ldquo;We can ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lost his way too, or he wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting there,&rdquo;
retorted the other. &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t sit about in the rain for fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the man observed their approach and,
rising, advanced to meet them with raised, arresting hand.</p>
<p>Wimsey brought the car to a standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said the stranger, who turned out to be a
youth in motor-cycling kit, &ldquo;but could you give me a hand
with my &rsquo;bus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she won&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed as much,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;Though why she
should wish to linger in a place like this beats me.&rdquo; He got out
of the car, and the youth, diving into the hedge, produced the
patient for inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tumble there or put her there?&rdquo; inquired Wimsey,
eyeing the machine distastefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put her there. I&rsquo;ve been kicking the starter for hours but
nothing happened, so I thought I&rsquo;d wait till somebody came
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. What is the matter, exactly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She was going beautifully and then she
conked out suddenly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you run out of petrol?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s plenty in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Plug all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The youth looked unhappy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only my
second time out, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well&mdash;there can&rsquo;t be much wrong. We&rsquo;ll just make
sure about the petrol first,&rdquo; said Wimsey, more cheerfully. He
unscrewed the filler-cap and turned his torch upon the interior
of the tank. &ldquo;Seems all right.&rdquo; He bent over again, whistling,
and replaced the cap. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give her another kick for luck and
then we&rsquo;ll look at the plug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man, thus urged, grasped the handle-bars, and
with the energy of despair delivered a kick which would have
done credit to an army mule. The engine roared into life in a
fury of vibration, racing heart-rendingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a miracle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter laid a gentle hand on the throttle-lever and the
shattering bellow calmed into a grateful purr.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do to it?&rdquo; demanded the cyclist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blew through the filler-cap,&rdquo; said his lordship with a grin.
&ldquo;Air-lock in the feed, old son, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightfully grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Look here, can you tell us the way to
Crofton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Straight down here. I&rsquo;m going there, as a matter
of fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven. Lead and I follow, as Sir Galahad says.
How far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decent inn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My governor keeps the &lsquo;Fox-and-Hounds.&rsquo; Would that
do? We&rsquo;d give you awfully decent grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorrow vanquished, labour ended, Jordan passed. Buzz
off, my lad. No, Charles, I will <i>not</i> wait while you put on a
Burberry. Back and side go bare, go bare, hand and foot go
cold, so belly-god send us good ale enough, whether it be new
or old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The starter hummed&mdash;the youth mounted his machine
and led off down the lane after one alarming wobble&mdash;Wimsey
slipped in the clutch and followed in his wake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>The &ldquo;Fox-and-Hounds&rdquo; turned out to be one of those
pleasant, old-fashioned inns where everything is upholstered
in horse-hair and it is never too late to obtain a good meal of
cold roast sirloin and home-grown salad. The landlady, Mrs.
Piggin, served the travellers herself. She wore a decent black
satin dress and a front of curls of the fashion favoured by the
Royal Family. Her round, cheerful face glowed in the firelight,
seeming to reflect the radiance of the scarlet-coated huntsmen
who galloped and leapt and fell on every wall through a series
of sporting prints. Lord Peter&rsquo;s mood softened under the influence
of the atmosphere and the house&rsquo;s excellent ale, and by
a series of inquiries directed to the hunting-season, just concluded,
the neighbouring families and the price of horseflesh,
he dexterously led the conversation round to the subject of the
late Miss Clara Whittaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Piggin, &ldquo;to be sure, we knew
Miss Whittaker. Everybody knew her in these parts. A wonderful
old lady she was. There&rsquo;s a many of her horses still in
the country. Mr. Cleveland, he bought the best part of the
stock, and is doin&rsquo; well with them. Fine honest stock she bred,
and they all used to say she was a woman of wonderful judgment
with a horse&mdash;or a man either. Nobody ever got the better of
her twice, and very few, once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Lord Peter, sagaciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember her well, riding to hounds when she was
well over sixty,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Piggin, &ldquo;and she wasn&rsquo;t one to
wait for a gap, neither. Now Miss Dawson&mdash;that was her friend
as lived with her&mdash;over at the Manor beyond the stone bridge&mdash;she
was more timid-like. She&rsquo;d go by the gates, and we often
used to say she&rsquo;d never be riding at all, but for bein&rsquo; that fond
of Miss Whittaker and not wanting to let her out of her sight.
But there, we can&rsquo;t all be alike, can we, sir?&mdash;and Miss Whittaker
was altogether out of the way. They don&rsquo;t make them like
that nowadays. Not but what these modern girls are good goers,
many of them, and does a lot of things as would have been
thought very fast in the old days, but Miss Whittaker had the
knowledge as well. Bought her own horses and physicked &rsquo;em
and bred &rsquo;em, and needed no advice from anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;She sounds a wonderful old girl,&rdquo; said Wimsey, heartily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have liked to know her. I&rsquo;ve got some friends who knew
Miss Dawson quite well&mdash;when she was living in Hampshire,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir? Well, that&rsquo;s strange, isn&rsquo;t it? She was a very
kind, nice lady. We heard she&rsquo;d died, too. Of this cancer, was
it? That&rsquo;s a terrible thing, poor soul. And fancy you being
connected with her, so to speak. I expect you&rsquo;d be interested
in some of our photographs of the Crofton Hunt. Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show these gentlemen the photographs of Miss Whittaker
and Miss Dawson. They&rsquo;re acquainted with some friends of
Miss Dawson down in Hampshire. Step this way&mdash;if you&rsquo;re
sure you won&rsquo;t take anything more, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Piggin led the way into a cosy little private bar, where
a number of hunting-looking gentlemen were enjoying a final
glass before closing-time. Piggin, stout and genial as his wife,
moved forward to do the honours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you have, gentlemen?&mdash;Joe, two pints of the winter
ale. And fancy you knowing our Miss Dawson. Dear me,
the world&rsquo;s a very small place, as I often says to my wife. Here&rsquo;s
the last group as was ever took of them, when the meet was
held at the Manor in 1918. Of course, you&rsquo;ll understand, it
wasn&rsquo;t a regular meet, like, owing to the War and the gentlemen
being away and the horses too&mdash;we couldn&rsquo;t keep things up
regular like in the old days. But what with the foxes gettin&rsquo; so
terrible many, and the packs all going to the dogs&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what I often used to say in this bar&mdash;the &rsquo;ounds is going
to the dogs, I says. Very good, they used to think it. There&rsquo;s
many a gentleman has laughed at me sayin&rsquo; that&mdash;the &rsquo;ounds,
I says, is goin&rsquo; to the dogs&mdash;well, as I was sayin&rsquo;, Colonel
Fletcher and some of the older gentlemen, they says, we must
carry on somehow, they says, and so they &rsquo;ad one or two scratch
meets as you might say, just to keep the pack from fallin&rsquo; to
pieces, as you might say. And Miss Whittaker, she says, &lsquo;&rsquo;Ave
the meet at the Manor, Colonel,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the last meet
I&rsquo;ll ever see, perhaps,&rsquo; she says. And so it was, poor lady, for
she &rsquo;ad a stroke in the New Year. She died in 1922. That&rsquo;s &rsquo;er,
sitting in the pony-carriage and Miss Dawson beside &rsquo;er. Of
course, Miss Whittaker &rsquo;ad &rsquo;ad to give up riding to &rsquo;ounds some
years before. She was gettin&rsquo; on, but she always followed in
the trap, up to the very last. &rsquo;Andsome old lady, ain&rsquo;t she, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Lord Peter and Parker looked with considerable interest at
the rather grim old woman sitting so uncompromisingly upright
with the reins in her hand. A dour, weather-beaten old face,
but certainly handsome still, with its large nose and straight,
heavy eyebrows. And beside her, smaller, plumper and more
feminine, was the Agatha Dawson whose curious death had
led them to this quiet country place. She had a sweet, smiling
face&mdash;less dominating than that of her redoubtable friend, but
full of spirit and character. Without doubt they had been a
remarkable pair of old ladies.</p>
<p>Lord Peter asked a question or two about the family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I can&rsquo;t say as I knows much about that. We
always understood as Miss Whittaker had quarrelled with her
people on account of comin&rsquo; here and settin&rsquo; up for herself. It
wasn&rsquo;t usual in them days for girls to leave home the way it is
now. But if you&rsquo;re particularly interested, sir, there&rsquo;s an old
gentleman here as can tell you all about the Whittakers and
the Dawsons too, and that&rsquo;s Ben Cobling. He was Miss Whittaker&rsquo;s
groom for forty years, and he married Miss Dawson&rsquo;s
maid as come with her from Norfolk. Eighty-six &rsquo;e was, last
birthday, but a grand old fellow still. We thinks a lot of Ben
Cobling in these parts. &rsquo;Im and his wife lives in the little cottage
what Miss Whittaker left them when she died. If you&rsquo;d like to
go round and see them to-morrow, sir, you&rsquo;ll find Ben&rsquo;s memory
as good as ever it was. Excuse me, sir, but it&rsquo;s time. I must get
&rsquo;em out of the bar.&mdash;Time, gentlemen, please! Three and
eightpence, sir, thank you, sir. Hurry up, gentlemen, please.
Now then, Joe, look sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great place, Crofton,&rdquo; said Lord Peter, when he and
Parker were left alone in a great, low-ceilinged bedroom, where
the sheets smelt of lavender. &ldquo;Ben Cobling&rsquo;s sure to know all
about Cousin Hallelujah. I&rsquo;m looking forward to Ben Cobling.&rdquo;</p>

<br><span class="h2line2">A Tale of Two Spinsters</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The power of perpetuating our property in our families is
one of the most valuable and interesting circumstances
belonging to it.</i>&rdquo;
<span class="jr">Burke, <i>Reflections on the Revolution</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="tb">The rainy night was followed by a sun-streaked morning. Lord
Peter, having wrapped himself affectionately round an abnormal
quantity of bacon and eggs, strolled out to bask at the door
of the &ldquo;Fox-and-Hounds.&rdquo; He filled a pipe slowly and meditated.
Within, a cheerful bustle in the bar announced the near
arrival of opening time. Eight ducks crossed the road in Indian
file. A cat sprang up upon the bench, stretched herself, tucked
her hind legs under her and coiled her tail tightly round them
as though to prevent them from accidentally working loose. A
groom passed, riding a tall bay horse and leading a chestnut
with a hogged mane; a spaniel followed them, running ridiculously,
with one ear flopped inside-out over his foolish head.</p>
<p>Lord Peter said, &ldquo;Hah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inn-door was set hospitably open by the barman, who
said, &ldquo;Good morning, sir; fine morning, sir,&rdquo; and vanished
within again.</p>
<p>Lord Peter said, &ldquo;Umph.&rdquo; He uncrossed his right foot from
over his left and straddled happily across the threshold.</p>
<p>Round the corner by the church-yard wall a little bent
figure hove into sight&mdash;an aged man with a wrinkled face and
legs incredibly bowed, his spare shanks enclosed in leather
gaiters. He advanced at a kind of brisk totter and civilly bared
his ancient head before lowering himself with an audible creak
on to the bench beside the cat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, sir,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Lord Peter. &ldquo;A beautiful day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it be, sir, that it be,&rdquo; said the old man, heartily.
&ldquo;When I sees a beautiful May day like this, I pray the Lord
He&rsquo;ll spare me to live in this wonderful world of His a few
years longer. I do indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look uncommonly fit,&rdquo; said his lordship, &ldquo;I should
think there was every chance of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still very hearty, sir, thank you, though I am eighty-seven
next Michaelmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter expressed a proper astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, eighty-seven, and if it wasn&rsquo;t for the rheumatics
I&rsquo;d have nothin&rsquo; to complain on. I&rsquo;m stronger maybe than what
I look. I knows I&rsquo;m a bit bent, sir, but that&rsquo;s the &rsquo;osses, sir,
more than age. Regular brought up with &rsquo;osses I&rsquo;ve been all
my life. Worked with &rsquo;em, slept with &rsquo;em&mdash;lived in a stable,
you might say, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have better company,&rdquo; said Lord Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, sir, you couldn&rsquo;t. My wife always used to
say she was jealous of the &rsquo;osses. Said I preferred their conversation
to hers. Well, maybe she was right, sir. A &rsquo;oss never
talks no foolishness, I says to her, and that&rsquo;s more than you
can always say of women, ain&rsquo;t it, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;What are you going to have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir, I&rsquo;ll have my usual pint of bitter. Jim
knows. Jim! Always start the day with a pint of bitter, sir. It&rsquo;s
&rsquo;olesomer than tea to my mind and don&rsquo;t fret the coats of the
stomach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;Now you mention
it, there is something fretful about tea. Mr. Piggin, two pints
of bitter, please, and will you join us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my lord,&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;Joe! Two large
bitters and a Guinness. Beautiful morning, my lord&mdash;&rsquo;morning,
Mr. Cobling&mdash;I see you&rsquo;ve made each other&rsquo;s acquaintance
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! So this is Mr. Cobling. I&rsquo;m delighted to see you.
I wanted particularly to have a chat with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was telling this gentleman&mdash;Lord Peter Wimsey his
name is&mdash;as you could tell him all about Miss Whittaker and
Miss Dawson. He knows friends of Miss Dawson&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed? Ah! There ain&rsquo;t much I <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> tell you about
them ladies. And proud I&rsquo;d be to do it. Fifty years I was with
Miss Whittaker. I come to her as under-groom in old Johnny
Blackthorne&rsquo;s time, and stayed on as headgroom after he died.
A rare young lady she was in them days. Deary me. Straight
as a switch, with a fine, high colour in her cheeks and shiny
black hair&mdash;just like a beautiful two-year-old filly she was. And
very sperrited. Wonnerful sperrited. There was a many gentlemen
as would have been glad to hitch up with her, but she
was never broke to harness. Like dirt, she treated &rsquo;em. Wouldn&rsquo;t
look at &rsquo;em, except it might be the grooms and stablehands in
a matter of &rsquo;osses. And in the way of business, of course. Well,
there is some creatures like that. I &rsquo;ad a terrier-bitch that way.
Great ratter she was. But a business woman&mdash;nothin&rsquo; else. I
tried &rsquo;er with all the dogs I could lay &rsquo;and to, but it weren&rsquo;t no
good. Bloodshed there was an&rsquo; sich a row&mdash;you never &rsquo;eard.
The Lord makes a few on &rsquo;em that way to suit &rsquo;Is own purposes,
I suppose. There ain&rsquo;t no arguin&rsquo; with females.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter said &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ale went down in silence.</p>
<p>Mr. Piggin roused himself presently from contemplation
to tell a story of Miss Whittaker in the hunting-field. Mr.
Cobling capped this by another. Lord Peter said &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Parker
then emerged and was introduced, and Mr. Cobling begged
the privilege of standing a round of drinks. This ritual accomplished,
Mr. Piggin begged the company would be his guests
for a third round, and then excused himself on the plea of
customers to attend to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>He went in, and Lord Peter, by skilful and maddeningly
slow degrees, began to work his way back to the history of the
Dawson family. Parker&mdash;educated at Barrow-in-Furness grammar
school and with his wits further sharpened in the London
police service&mdash;endeavoured now and again to get matters
along faster by a brisk question. The result, every time, was to
make Mr. Cobling lose the thread of his remarks and start him
off into a series of interminable side-tracks. Wimsey kicked his
friend viciously on the anklebone to keep him quiet, and with
endless patience worked the conversation back to the main road
again.</p>
<p>At the end of an hour or so, Mr. Cobling explained that
his wife could tell them a great deal more about Miss Dawson
than what he could, and invited them to visit his cottage. This
invitation being accepted with alacrity, the party started off,
Mr. Cobling explaining to Parker that he was eighty-seven come
next Michaelmas, and hearty still, indeed, stronger than he
appeared, bar the rheumatics that troubled him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying
as I&rsquo;m not bent,&rdquo; said Mr. Cobling, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s more the work
of the &rsquo;osses. Regular lived with &rsquo;osses all my life&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so fretful, Charles,&rdquo; murmured Wimsey in
his ear, &ldquo;it must be the tea at breakfast&mdash;it frets the coats of
the stomach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Cobling turned out to be a delightful old lady, exactly
like a dried-up pippin and only two years younger than her
husband. She was entranced at getting an opportunity to talk
about her darling Miss Agatha. Parker, thinking it necessary to
put forward some reason for the inquiry, started on an involved
explanation, and was kicked again. To Mrs. Cobling, nothing
could be more natural than that all the world should be interested
in the Dawsons, and she prattled gaily on without
prompting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>She had been in the Dawson family service as a girl&mdash;almost
born in it as you might say. Hadn&rsquo;t her mother been
housekeeper to Mr. Henry Dawson, Miss Agatha&rsquo;s papa, and
to his father before him? She herself had gone to the big house
as stillroom maid when she wasn&rsquo;t but fifteen. That was when
Miss Harriet was only three years old&mdash;her as afterwards married
Mr. James Whittaker. Yes, and she&rsquo;d been there when the
rest of the family was born. Mr. Stephen&mdash;him as should have
been the heir&mdash;ah, dear! only the trouble came and that killed
his poor father and there was nothing left. Yes, a sad business
that was. Poor Mr. Henry speculated with something&mdash;Mrs.
Cobling wasn&rsquo;t clear what, but it was all very wicked and happened
in London where there were so many wicked people&mdash;and
the long and the short was, he lost it all, poor gentleman,
and never held up his head again. Only fifty-four he was when
he died; such a fine upright gentleman with a pleasant word
for everybody. And his wife didn&rsquo;t live long after him, poor
lamb. She was a Frenchwoman and a sweet lady, but she was
very lonely in England, having no family and her two sisters
walled up alive in one of them dreadful Romish Convents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did Mr. Stephen do when the money went?&rdquo;
asked Wimsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him? Oh, he went into business&mdash;a strange thing that
did seem, though I have heard tell as old Barnabas Dawson,
Mr. Henry&rsquo;s grandfather that was, was nought but a grocer or
something of that&mdash;and they do say, don&rsquo;t they, that from
shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves is three generations? Still, it was very
hard on Mr. Stephen, as had always been brought up to have
everything of the best. And engaged to be married to a beautiful
lady, too, and a very rich heiress. But it was all for the best,
for when she heard Mr. Stephen was a poor man after all, she
threw him over, and that showed she had no heart in her at
all. Mr. Stephen never married till he was over forty, and then
it was a lady with no family at all&mdash;not lawful, that is, though
she was a dear, sweet girl and made Mr. Stephen a most splendid
wife&mdash;she did indeed. And Mr. John, he was their only
son. They thought the world of him. It was a terrible day when
the news came that he was killed in the War. A cruel business
that was, sir, wasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;and nobody the better for it as I
can see, but all these shocking hard taxes, and the price of
everything gone up so, and so many out of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he was killed? That must have been a terrible grief to
his parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, terrible. Oh, it was an awful thing altogether,
sir, for poor Mr. Stephen, as had had so much trouble all his
life, he went out of his poor mind and shot hisself. Out of his
mind he must have been, sir, to do it&mdash;and what was more
dreadful still, he shot his dear lady as well. You may remember
it, sir. There was pieces in the paper about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;I seem to have some vague recollection of it,&rdquo; said Peter,
quite untruthfully, but anxious not to seem to belittle the local
tragedy. &ldquo;And young John&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t married, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. That was very sad, too. He was engaged to a
young lady&mdash;a nurse in one of the English hospitals, as we
understood, and he was hoping to get back and be married to
her on his next leave. Everything did seem to go all wrong
together them terrible years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady sighed, and wiped her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Stephen was the only son, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly, sir. There was the darling twins. Such
pretty children, but they only lived two days. They come four
years after Miss Harriet&mdash;her as married Mr. James Whittaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. That was how the families became connected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Miss Agatha and Miss Harriet and Miss Clara
Whittaker was all at the same school together, and Mrs. Whittaker
asked the two young ladies to go and spend their holidays
with Miss Clara, and that was when Mr. James fell in love
with Miss Harriet. She wasn&rsquo;t as pretty as Miss Agatha, to my
thinking, but she was livelier and quicker&mdash;and then, of course,
Miss Agatha was never one for flirting and foolishness. Often
she used to say to me, &lsquo;Betty,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I mean to be an old
maid and so does Miss Clara, and we&rsquo;re going to live together
and be ever so happy, without any stupid, tiresome gentlemen.&rsquo;
And so it turned out, sir, as you know, for Miss Agatha, for
all she was so quiet, was very determined. Once she&rsquo;d said a
thing, you couldn&rsquo;t turn her from it&mdash;not with reasons, nor
with threats, nor with coaxings&mdash;nothing! Many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve
tried when she was a child&mdash;for I used to give a little help in
the nursery sometimes, sir. You might drive her into a temper
or into the sulks, but you couldn&rsquo;t make her change her little
mind, even then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came to Wimsey&rsquo;s mind the picture of the stricken,
helpless old woman, holding to her own way in spite of her
lawyer&rsquo;s reasoning and her niece&rsquo;s subterfuge. A remarkable
old lady, certainly, in her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the Dawson family has practically died out,
then,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir. There&rsquo;s only Miss Mary now&mdash;and she&rsquo;s a
Whittaker, of course. She is Miss Harriet&rsquo;s grand-daughter, Mr.
Charles Whittaker&rsquo;s only child. She was left all alone, too,
when she went to live with Miss Dawson. Mr. Charles and his
wife was killed in one of these dreadful motors&mdash;dear, dear&mdash;it
seemed we was fated to have nothing but one tragedy after
another. Just to think of Ben and me outliving them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, Mother,&rdquo; said Ben, laying his hand on hers.
&ldquo;The Lord have been wonderful good to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That He have. Three sons we have, sir, and two daughters,
and fourteen grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
Maybe you&rsquo;d like to see their pictures, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter said he should like to very much, and Parker
made confirmatory noises. The life-histories of all the children
and descendants were detailed at suitable length. Whenever a
pause seemed discernible, Parker would mutter hopefully in
Wimsey&rsquo;s car, &ldquo;How about Cousin Hallelujah?&rdquo; but before a
question could be put, the interminable family chronicle was
resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for God&rsquo;s sake, Charles,&rdquo; whispered Peter, savagely,
when Mrs. Cobling had risen to hunt for the shawl which
Grandson William had sent home from the Dardanelles, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
keep saying Hallelujah at me! I&rsquo;m not a revival meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shawl being duly admired, the conversation turned
upon foreign parts, natives and black people generally, following
on which, Lord Peter added carelessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, hasn&rsquo;t the Dawson family got some sort of
connections in those foreign countries, somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, yes, said Mrs. Cobling, in rather a shocked tone.
There had been Mr. Paul, Mr. Henry&rsquo;s brother. But he was
not mentioned much. He had been a terrible shock to his
family. In fact&mdash;a gasp here, and a lowering of the voice&mdash;he
had <i>turned Papist</i> and become&mdash;a monk! (Had he become a
murderer, apparently, he could hardly have done worse.) Mr.
Henry had always blamed himself very much in the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was it his fault?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, Mr. Henry&rsquo;s wife&mdash;my dear mistress,
you see, sir&mdash;she was French, as I told you, and of course,
<i>she</i> was a Papist. Being brought up that way, she wouldn&rsquo;t know
any better, naturally, and she was very young when she was
married. But Mr. Henry soon taught her to be a Christian,
and she put away her idolatrous ideas and went to the parish
church. But Mr. Paul, <i>he</i> fell in love with one of her sisters,
and the sister had been vowed to religion, as they called it,
and had shut herself up in a nunnery.&rdquo; And then Mr. Paul
had broken his heart and &ldquo;gone over&rdquo; to the Scarlet Woman
and&mdash;again the pause and the hush&mdash;become a monk. A
terrible to-do it made. And he&rsquo;d lived to be a very old man,
and for all Mrs. Cobling knew was living yet, still in the error
of his ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; murmured Parker, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s probably the real
heir. He&rsquo;d be Agatha Dawson&rsquo;s uncle and her nearest relation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wimsey frowned and returned to the charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it couldn&rsquo;t have been Mr. Paul I had in mind,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;because this sort of relation of Miss Agatha Dawson&rsquo;s
that I heard about was a real foreigner&mdash;in fact, a very dark-complexioned
man&mdash;almost a black man or so I was told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black?&rdquo; cried the old lady&mdash;&ldquo;oh, no, sir&mdash;that couldn&rsquo;t
be. Unless&mdash;dear Lord a&rsquo; mercy, it couldn&rsquo;t be that, surely!
Ben, do you think it could be that?&mdash;Old Simon, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben shook his head. &ldquo;I never heard tell much about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor nobody did,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Cobling, energetically.
&ldquo;He was a long way back, but they had tales of him in the
family. &lsquo;Wicked Simon,&rsquo; they called him. He sailed away to
the Indies, many years ago, and nobody knew what became of
him. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a queer thing, like, if he was to have
married a black wife out in them parts, and this was his&mdash;oh,
dear&mdash;his grandson it &rsquo;ud have to be, if not his great-grandson,
for he was Mr. Henry&rsquo;s uncle, and that&rsquo;s a long time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was disappointing. A grandson of &ldquo;old Simon&rsquo;s&rdquo; would
surely be too distant a relative to dispute Mary Whittaker&rsquo;s title.
However:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very interesting,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;Was it the East
Indies or the West Indies he went to, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Cobling didn&rsquo;t know, but she believed it was something
to do with America.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity as Mr. Probyn ain&rsquo;t in England any longer. He
could have told you more about the family than what I can.
But he retired last year and went away to Italy or some such
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was Miss Whittaker&rsquo;s solicitor,&rdquo; said Ben, &ldquo;and he
managed all Miss Dawson&rsquo;s business, too. A nice gentleman
he was, but uncommon sharp&mdash;ha, ha! Never gave nothing
away. But that&rsquo;s lawyers all the world over,&rdquo; added he, shrewdly,
&ldquo;take all and give nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he live in Crofton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, in Croftover Magna, twelve miles from here.
Pointer &amp; Winkin have his business now, but they&rsquo;re young
men, and I don&rsquo;t know much about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having by this time heard all the Coblings had to tell,
Wimsey and Parker gradually disentangled themselves and took
their leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Cousin Hallelujah&rsquo;s a wash-out,&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly&mdash;possibly not. There may be some connection.
Still, I certainly think the disgraceful and papistical Mr. Paul
is more promising. Obviously Mr. Probyn is the bird to get
hold of. You realise who he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the mysterious solicitor, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he is. He knows why Miss Dawson ought to
have made her will. And we&rsquo;re going straight off to Croftover
Magna to look up Messrs. Pointer &amp; Winkin, and see what
they have to say about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unhappily, Messrs. Pointer &amp; Winkin had nothing to say
whatever. Miss Dawson had withdrawn her affairs from Mr.
Probyn&rsquo;s hands and had lodged all the papers with her new
solicitor. Messrs. Pointer &amp; Winkin had never had any connection
with the Dawson family. They had no objection, however,
to furnishing Mr. Probyn&rsquo;s address&mdash;Villa Bianca, Fiesole.
They regretted that they could be of no further assistance to
Lord Peter Wimsey and Mr. Parker. Good morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Short and sour,&rdquo; was his lordship&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Well,
well&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have a spot of lunch and write a letter to Mr.
Probyn and another to my good friend Bishop Lambert of the
Orinoco Mission to get a line on Cousin Hallelujah, Smile,
smile, smile. As Ingoldsby says: &lsquo;The breezes are blowing a
race, a race! The breezes are blowing&mdash;we near the chase!&rsquo;
Do ye ken John Peel? Likewise, know&rsquo;st thou the land where
blooms the citron-flower? Well, never mind if you don&rsquo;t&mdash;you
can always look forward to going there for your honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br><span class="h2line2">Hallelujah</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Our ancestors are very good kind of folks, but they are
the last people I should choose to have a visiting
acquaintance with.</i>&rdquo;
<span class="jr">Sheridan, <i>The Rivals</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="tb">That excellent prelate, Bishop Lambert of the Orinoco Mission,
proved to be a practical and kind man. He did not personally
know the Rev. Hallelujah Dawson, but thought he
might belong to the Tabernacle Mission&mdash;a Nonconformist
body which was doing a very valuable work in those parts. He
would himself communicate with the London Headquarters
of this community and let Lord Peter know the result. Two
hours later, Bishop Lambert&rsquo;s secretary had duly rung up the
Tabernacle Mission and received the very satisfactory information
that the Rev. Hallelujah Dawson was in England, and,
indeed, available at their Mission House in Stepney. He was
an elderly minister, living in very reduced circumstances&mdash;in
fact, the Bishop rather gathered that the story was a sad one&mdash;Oh,
not at all, pray, no thanks. The Bishop&rsquo;s poor miserable
slave of a secretary did all the work. Very glad to hear from
Lord Peter, and was he being good? Ha, ha! and when was he
coming to dine with the Bishop?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Lord Peter promptly gathered up Parker and swooped down
with him upon the Tabernacle Mission, before whose dim and
grim frontage Mrs. Merdle&rsquo;s long black bonnet and sweeping
copper exhaust made an immense impression. The small fry
of the neighbourhood had clustered about her and were practising
horn solos almost before Wimsey had rung the bell. On
Parker&rsquo;s threatening them with punishment and casually informing
them that he was a police officer, they burst into
ecstasies of delight, and joining hands, formed a ring-o&rsquo;-roses
round him, under the guidance of a sprightly young woman
of twelve years old or thereabouts. Parker made a few harassed
darts at them, but the ring only broke up, shrieking with laughter,
and reformed, singing. The Mission door opened at the
moment, displaying this undignified exhibition to the eyes of
a lank young man in spectacles, who shook a long finger disapprovingly
and said, &ldquo;Now, you children,&rdquo; without the slightest
effect and apparently without the faintest expectation of
producing any.</p>
<p>Lord Peter explained his errand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come in, please,&rdquo; said the young man, who had one
finger in a book of theology. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your friend&mdash;er&mdash;this
is rather a noisy district.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker shook himself free from his tormentors, and advanced,
breathing threatenings and slaughter, to which the
enemy responded by a derisive blast of the horn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll run those batteries down,&rdquo; said Wimsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do anything with the little devils,&rdquo; growled
Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you treat them as human beings?&rdquo; retorted
Wimsey. &ldquo;Children are creatures of like passions with politicians
and financiers. Here, Esmeralda!&rdquo; he added, beckoning
to the ringleader.</p>
<p>The young woman put her tongue out and made a rude
gesture, but observing the glint of coin in the outstretched
hand, suddenly approached and stood challengingly before
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s half a crown&mdash;thirty
pennies, you know. Any use to you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>The child promptly proved her kinship with humanity.
She became abashed in the presence of wealth, and was silent,
rubbing one dusty shoe upon the calf of her stocking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You appear,&rdquo; pursued Lord Peter, &ldquo;to be able to keep your
young friends in order if you choose. I take you, in fact, for a
woman of character. Very well, if you keep them from touching
my car while I&rsquo;m in the house, you get this half-crown, see?
But if you let &rsquo;em blow the horn, I shall hear it. Every time
the horn goes, you lose a penny, got that? If the horn blows
six times, you only get two bob. If I hear it thirty times, you
don&rsquo;t get anything. And I shall look out from time to time,
and if I see anybody mauling the car about or sitting in it, <i>then</i>
you don&rsquo;t get anything. Do I make myself clear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I takes care o&rsquo; yer car fer &rsquo;arf a crahn. An&rsquo; ef the &rsquo;orn
goes, you docks a copper &rsquo;orf of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, mister. I&rsquo;ll see none on &rsquo;em touches it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl. Now, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spectacled young man led them into a gloomy little
waiting-room, suggestive of a railway station and hung with
Old Testament prints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Mr. Dawson you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; said he, and vanished,
with the volume of theology still clutched in his hand.</p>
<p>Presently a shuffling step was heard on the coconut matting,
and Wimsey and Parker braced themselves to confront
the villainous claimant.</p>
<p>The door, however, opened to admit an elderly West Indian,
of so humble and inoffensive an appearance that the
hearts of the two detectives sank into their boots. Anything less
murderous could scarcely be imagined, as he stood blinking
nervously at them from behind a pair of steel-rimmed spectacles,
the frames of which had at one time been broken and
bound with twine.</p>
<p>The Rev. Hallelujah Dawson was undoubtedly a man of
colour. He had the pleasant, slightly aquiline features and
brown-olive skin of the Polynesian. His hair was scanty and
greyish&mdash;not woolly, but closely curled. His stooping shoulders
were clad in a threadbare clerical coat. His black eyes, yellow
about the whites and slightly protruding, rolled amiably at
them, and his smile was open and frank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;You asked to see me?&rdquo; he began, in perfect English, but
with the soft native intonation. &ldquo;I think I have not the pleasure&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Dawson? Yes. We are&mdash;er&mdash;makin&rsquo;
certain inquiries&mdash;er&mdash;in connection with the family of the
Dawsons of Crofton in Warwickshire, and it has been suggested
that you might be able to enlighten us, what? as to their West
Indian connections&mdash;if you would be so good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; The old man drew himself up slightly. &ldquo;I am
myself&mdash;in a way&mdash;a descendant of the family. Won&rsquo;t you sit
down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. We thought you might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not come from Miss Whittaker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something eager, yet defensive in the tone.
Wimsey, not quite knowing what was behind it, chose the
discreeter part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. We are&mdash;preparin&rsquo; a work on County Families,
don&rsquo;t you know. Tombstones and genealogies and that sort of
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;yes&mdash;I hoped perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; The mild tones died away
in a sigh. &ldquo;But I shall be very happy to help you in any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the question now is, what became of Simon Dawson?
We know that he left his family and sailed for the West
Indies in&mdash;ah!&mdash;in seventeen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen hundred and ten,&rdquo; said the old man, with surprising
quickness. &ldquo;Yes. He got into trouble when he was a lad
of sixteen. He took up with bad men older than himself, and
became involved in a very terrible affair. It had to do with
gaming, and a man was killed. Not in a duel&mdash;in those days
that would not have been considered disgraceful&mdash;though violence
is always displeasing to the Lord&mdash;but the man was
foully murdered and Simon Dawson and his friends fled from
justice. Simon fell in with the press-gang and was carried off
to sea. He served fifteen years and was then taken by a French
privateer. Later on he escaped and&mdash;to cut a long story short&mdash;got
away to Trinidad under another name. Some English people
there were kind to him and gave him work on their sugar
plantation. He did well there and eventually became owner of
a small plantation of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;What was the name he went by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harkaway. I suppose he was afraid that they would get
hold of him as a deserter from the Navy if he went by his own
name. No doubt he should have reported his escape. Anyway,
he liked plantation life and was quite satisfied to stay where he
was. I don&rsquo;t suppose he would have cared to go home, even
to claim his inheritance. And then, there was always the matter
of the murder, you know&mdash;though I dare say they would not
have brought that trouble up against him, seeing he was so
young when it happened and it was not his hand that did the
awful deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His inheritance? Was he the eldest son, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Barnabas was the eldest, but he was killed at Waterloo
and left no family. Then there was a second son, Roger, but
he died of smallpox as a child. Simon was the third son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was the fourth son who took the estate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Frederick. He was Henry&rsquo;s Dawson&rsquo;s father. They
tried, of course, to find out what became of Simon, but in
those days it was very difficult, you understand, to get information
from foreign places, and Simon had quite disappeared.
So they had to pass him over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what happened to Simon&rsquo;s children?&rdquo; asked Parker.
&ldquo;Did he have any?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clergyman nodded, and a deep, dusky flush showed
under his dark skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am his grandson,&rdquo; he said, simply. &ldquo;That is why I came
over to England. When the Lord called me to feed His lambs
among my own people, I was in quite good circumstances. I
had the little sugar plantation which had come down to me
through my father, and I married and was very happy. But we
fell on bad times&mdash;the sugar crop failed, and our little flock
became smaller and poorer and could not give so much support
to their minister. Besides, I was getting too old and frail to do
my work&mdash;and I have a sick wife, too, and God has blessed
us with many daughters, who needed our care. I was in great
straits. And then I came upon some old family papers belonging
to my grandfather, Simon, and learned that his name was not
Harkaway but Dawson, and I thought, maybe I had a family
in England and that God would yet raise up a table in the
wilderness. Accordingly, when the time came to send a representative
home to our London Headquarters, I asked permission
to resign my ministry out there and come over to
England.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get into touch with anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I went to Crofton&mdash;which was mentioned in my
grandfather&rsquo;s letters&mdash;and saw a lawyer in the town there&mdash;a
Mr. Probyn of Croftover. You know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He was very kind, and very much interested to see
me. He showed me the genealogy of the family, and how my
grandfather should have been the heir to the property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the property had been lost by that time, had it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And, unfortunately&mdash;when I showed him my grandmother&rsquo;s
marriage certificate, he&mdash;he told me that it was no
certificate at all. I fear that Simon Dawson was a sad sinner.
He took my grandmother to live with him, as many of the
planters did take women of colour, and he gave her a document
which was supposed to be a certificate of marriage signed by
the Governor of the country. But when Mr. Probyn inquired
into it, he found that it was all a sham, and no such governor
had ever existed. It was distressing to my feelings as a Christian,
of course&mdash;but since there was no property, it didn&rsquo;t make any
actual difference to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was bad luck,&rdquo; said Peter, sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I called resignation to my aid,&rdquo; said the old Indian, with
a dignified little bow. &ldquo;Mr. Probyn was also good enough to
send me with a letter of introduction to Miss Agatha Dawson,
the only surviving member of our family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she lived at Leahampton.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;She received me in the most charming way, and when I
told her who I was&mdash;acknowledging, of course, that I had not
the slightest claim upon her&mdash;she was good enough to make
me an allowance of &pound;100 a year, which she continued till her
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that the only time you saw her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I would not intrude upon her. It could not be
agreeable to her to have a relative of my complexion continually
at her house,&rdquo; said the Rev. Hallelujah, with a kind of proud
humility. &ldquo;But she gave me lunch, and spoke very kindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;forgive my askin&rsquo;&mdash;hope it isn&rsquo;t impertinent&mdash;but
does Miss Whittaker keep up the allowance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no&mdash;I&mdash;perhaps I should not expect it, but it would
have made a great difference to our circumstances. And Miss
Dawson rather led me to hope that it might be continued. She
told me that she did not like the idea of making a will, but,
she said, &lsquo;It is not necessary at all, Cousin Hallelujah, Mary
will have all my money when I am gone, and she can continue
the allowance on my behalf.&rsquo; But perhaps Miss Whittaker did
not get the money after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she did. It is very odd. She may have forgotten
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took the liberty of writing her a few words of spiritual
comfort when her aunt died. Perhaps that did not please her.
Of course, I did not write again. Yet I am loath to believe that
she has hardened her heart against the unfortunate. No doubt
there is some explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Lord Peter. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m very grateful to
you for your kindness. That has quite cleared up the little matter
of Simon and his descendants. I&rsquo;ll just make a note of the
names and dates, if I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. I will bring you the paper which Mr. Probyn
kindly made out for me, showing the whole of the family.
Excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not gone long, and soon reappeared with a genealogy,
neatly typed out on a legal-looking sheet of blue paper.</p>
<p>Wimsey began to note down the particulars concerning
Simon Dawson and his son, Bosun, and his grandson, Hallelujah.
Suddenly he put his finger on an entry further along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Charles,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here is our Father Paul&mdash;the
bad boy who turned R.C. and became a monk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;So he is. But&mdash;he&rsquo;s dead, Peter&mdash;died in 1922, three
years before Agatha Dawson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We must wash him out. Well, these little setbacks
will occur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They finished their notes, bade farewell to the Rev. Hallelujah,
and emerged to find Esmeralda valiantly defending
Mrs. Merdle against all comers. Lord Peter handed over the
half-crown and took delivery of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more I hear of Mary Whittaker,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the less
I like her. She might at least have given poor old Cousin
Hallelujah his hundred quid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a rapacious female,&rdquo; agreed Parker. &ldquo;Well, anyway,
Father Paul&rsquo;s safely dead, and Cousin Hallelujah is illegitimately
descended. So there&rsquo;s an end of the long-lost claimant
from overseas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it all!&rdquo; cried Wimsey, taking both hands from the
steering-wheel and scratching his head, to Parker&rsquo;s extreme
alarm, &ldquo;that strikes a familiar chord. Now where in thunder
have I heard those words before?&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Murbles is coming round to dinner to-night, Charles,&rdquo; said
Wimsey. &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d stop and have grub with us too. I want
to put all this family history business before him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you dining?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, at the flat. I&rsquo;m sick of restaurant meals. Bunter does
a wonderful bloody steak and there are new peas and potatoes
and genuine English grass. Gerald sent it up from Denver
specially. You can&rsquo;t buy it. Come along. Ye olde English fare,
don&rsquo;t you know, and a bottle of what Pepys calls Ho Bryon.
Do you good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker accepted. But he noticed that, even when speaking
on his beloved subject of food, Wimsey was vague and abstracted.
Something seemed to be worrying at the back of his
mind, and even when Mr. Murbles appeared, full of mild legal
humour, Wimsey listened to him with extreme courtesy indeed,
but with only half his attention.</p>
<p>They were partly through dinner when, a propos of nothing,
Wimsey suddenly brought his fist down on the mahogany
with a crash that startled even Bunter, causing him to jerk a
great crimson splash of the Haut Brion over the edge of the
glass upon the tablecloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it!&rdquo; said Lord Peter.</p>
<p>Bunter in a low shocked voice begged his lordship&rsquo;s pardon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murbles,&rdquo; said Wimsey, without heeding him, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t there
a new Property Act?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles, in some surprise. He had
been in the middle of a story when the interruption occurred,
and was a little put out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew I&rsquo;d read that sentence somewhere&mdash;you know,
Charles&mdash;about doing away with the long-lost claimant from
overseas. It was in some paper or other about a couple of years
ago, and it had to do with the new Act. Of course, it said what
a blow it would be to romantic novelists. Doesn&rsquo;t the Act wash
out the claims of distant relatives, Murbles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a sense, it does,&rdquo; replied the solicitor. &ldquo;Not, of course,
in the case of entailed property, which has its own rules. But
I understand you to refer to ordinary personal property or real
estate not entailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;what happens to that, now, if the owner of the
property dies without making a will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is rather a complicated matter,&rdquo; began Mr. Murbles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look here, first of all&mdash;before the jolly old Act was
passed, the next-of-kin got it all, didn&rsquo;t he&mdash;no matter if he
was only a seventh cousin fifteen times removed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a general way, that is correct. If there was a husband
or wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wash out the husband and wife. Suppose the person is
unmarried and has no near relations living. It would have
gone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the next-of-kin, whoever that was, if he or she could
be traced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if you had to burrow back to William the Conqueror
to get at the relationship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always supposing you could get a clear record back to so
very early a date,&rdquo; replied Mr. Murbles. &ldquo;It is, of course, in
the highest degree improbable&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know, sir. But what happens now in such a
case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new Act makes inheritance on intestacy very much
simpler,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles, setting his knife and fork together,
placing both elbows on the table and laying the index-finger
of his right hand against his left thumb in a gesture of tabulation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet it does,&rdquo; interpolated Wimsey. &ldquo;I know what an Act
to make things simpler means. It means that the people who
drew it up don&rsquo;t understand it themselves and that every one
of its clauses needs a law-suit to disentangle it. But do go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the new Act,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Murbles, &ldquo;one half of
the property goes to the husband and wife, if living, and subject
to his or her life-interest, then all to the children equally. But
if there be no spouse and no children, then it goes to the father
or mother of the deceased. If the father and mother are both
dead, then everything goes to the brothers and sisters of the
whole blood who are living at the time, but if any brother or
sister dies before the intestate, then to his or her issue. In case
there are no brothers or sisters of the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, stop! you needn&rsquo;t go any further. You&rsquo;re absolutely
sure of that? It goes to the brothers&rsquo; or sisters&rsquo; issue?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That is to say, if it were you that died intestate and
your brother Gerald and your sister Mary were already dead,
your money would be equally divided among your nieces and
nephews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but suppose they were already dead too&mdash;suppose
I&rsquo;d gone tediously living on till I&rsquo;d nothing left but great-nephews
and great-nieces&mdash;would they inherit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why, yes, I suppose they would,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles,
with less certainty, however. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I think they would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearly they would,&rdquo; said Parker, a little impatiently, &ldquo;if
it says to the issue of the deceased&rsquo;s brothers and sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but we must not be precipitate,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles,
rounding upon him. &ldquo;To the lay mind, doubtless, the word
&lsquo;issue&rsquo; appears a simple one. But in law&rdquo;&mdash;(Mr. Murbles, who
up till this point had held the index-finger of the right hand
poised against the ring-finger of the left, in recognition of the
claims of the brothers and sisters of the half-blood, now placed
his left palm upon the table and wagged his right index-finger
admonishingly in Parker&rsquo;s direction)&mdash;&ldquo;in <i>law</i> the word may
bear one of two, or indeed several, interpretations according
to the nature of the document in which it occurs and the date
of that document.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in the new Act&mdash;&rdquo; urged Lord Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not, particularly,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles, &ldquo;a specialist
in the law concerning property, and I should not like to give
a decided opinion as to its interpretation, all the more as, up
to the present, no case has come before the Courts bearing on
the present issue&mdash;no pun intended, ha, ha, ha! But my immediate
and entirely tentative opinion&mdash;which, however, I
should advise you not to accept without the support of some
weightier authority&mdash;would be, I <i>think</i>, that issue in this case
means issue <i>ad infinitum</i>, and that therefore the great-nephews
and great-nieces would be entitled to inherit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there might be another opinion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;the question is a complicated one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; groaned Peter. &ldquo;I <i>knew</i> this simplifying
Act would cause a shockin&rsquo; lot of muddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles, &ldquo;exactly why you want to
know all this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said Wimsey, taking from his pocket-book the
genealogy of the Dawson family which he had received from
the Rev. Hallelujah Dawson, &ldquo;here is the point. We have always
talked about Mary Whittaker as Agatha Dawson&rsquo;s niece; she
was always called so and she speaks of the old lady as her aunt.
But if you look at this, you will see that actually she was no
nearer to her than great-niece: she was the grand-daughter of
Agatha&rsquo;s sister Harriet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles, &ldquo;but still, she was apparently
the nearest surviving relative, and since Agatha Dawson
died in 1925, the money passed without any question to
Mary Whittaker under the old Property Act. There&rsquo;s no ambiguity
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;none whatever, that&rsquo;s the point.
But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; broke in Parker, &ldquo;I see what you&rsquo;re driving
at. When did the new Act come into force, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In January, 1926,&rdquo; replied Mr. Murbles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Miss Dawson died, rather unexpectedly, as we know,
in November, 1925,&rdquo; went on Peter. &ldquo;But supposing she had
lived, as the doctor fully expected her to do, till February or
March, 1926&mdash;are you absolutely positive, sir, that Mary
Whittaker would have inherited then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Murbles opened his mouth to speak&mdash;and shut it
again. He rubbed his hands very slowly the one over the other.
He removed his eyeglasses and resettled them more firmly on
his nose. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right, Lord Peter,&rdquo; he said in a grave tone,
&ldquo;this is a very serious and important point. Much too serious
for me to give an opinion on. If I understand you rightly, you
are suggesting that any ambiguity in the interpretation of the
new Act might provide an interested party with a very good
and sufficient motive for hastening the death of Agatha Dawson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do mean exactly that. Of course, if the great-niece
inherits anyhow, the old lady might as well die under the new
Act as under the old. But if there was any doubt about it&mdash;how
tempting, don&rsquo;t you see, to give her a little push over the
edge, so as to make her die in 1925. Especially as she couldn&rsquo;t
live long anyhow, and there were no other relatives to be defrauded.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; put in Parker, &ldquo;suppose the great-niece
is excluded from the inheritance, where does the money
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It goes to the Duchy of Lancaster&mdash;or in other words,
to the Crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;to no one in particular. Upon my
soul, I really can&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s very much of a crime to bump
a poor old thing off a bit previously when she&rsquo;s sufferin&rsquo; horribly,
just to get the money she intends you to have. Why the devil
should the Duchy of Lancaster have it? Who cares about the
Duchy of Lancaster? It&rsquo;s like defrauding the Income Tax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethically,&rdquo; observed Mr. Murbles, &ldquo;there may be much
to be said for your point of view. Legally, I am afraid, murder
is murder, however frail the victim or convenient the result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Agatha Dawson didn&rsquo;t want to die,&rdquo; added Parker,
&ldquo;she said so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Wimsey, thoughtfully, &ldquo;and I suppose she had
a right to an opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles, &ldquo;that before we go any further,
we ought to consult a specialist in this branch of the law. I
wonder whether Towkington is at home. He is quite the ablest
authority I could name. Greatly as I dislike that modern invention,
the telephone, I think it might be advisable to ring
him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Towkington proved to be at home and at liberty. The
case of the great-niece was put to him over the &rsquo;phone. Mr.
Towkington, taken at a disadvantage without his authorities,
and hazarding an opinion on the spur of the moment, thought
that in all probability the great-niece would be excluded from
the succession under the new Act. But it was an interesting
point, and he would be glad of an opportunity to verify his
references. Would not Mr. Murbles come round and talk it
over with him? Mr. Murbles explained that he was at that
moment dining with two friends who were interested in the
question. In that case, would not the two friends also come
round and see Mr. Towkington?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Towkington has some very excellent port,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles,
in a cautious aside, and clapping his hand over the mouth-piece
of the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not go and try it?&rdquo; said Wimsey, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only as far as Gray&rsquo;s Inn,&rdquo; continued Mr. Murbles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the better,&rdquo; said Lord Peter.</p>
<p>Mr. Murbles released the telephone and thanked Mr.
Towkington. The party would start at once for Gray&rsquo;s Inn. Mr.
Towkington was heard to say, &ldquo;Good, good,&rdquo; in a hearty manner
before ringing off.</p>
<p>On their arrival at Mr. Towkington&rsquo;s chambers the oak
was found to be hospitably unsported, and almost before they
could knock, Mr. Towkington himself flung open the door and
greeted them in a loud and cheerful tone. He was a large,
square man with a florid face and a harsh voice. In court, he
was famous for a way of saying, &ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; as a preface to
tying recalcitrant witnesses into tight knots, which he would
then proceed to slash open with a brilliant confutation. He
knew Wimsey by sight, expressed himself delighted to meet
Inspector Parker, and bustled his guests into the room with
jovial shouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been going into this little matter while you were
coming along,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Awkward, eh? ha! Astonishing thing
that people can&rsquo;t say what they mean when they draw Acts,
eh? ha! Why do you suppose it is, Lord Peter, eh? ha! Come
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect it&rsquo;s because Acts are drawn up by lawyers,&rdquo; said
Wimsey with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make work for themselves, eh? I daresay you&rsquo;re right.
Even lawyers must live, eh? ha! Very good. Well now, Murbles,
let&rsquo;s just have this case again, in greater detail, d&rsquo;you mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Murbles explained the matter again, displaying the
genealogical table and putting forward the point as regards a
possible motive for murder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Towkington, much delighted,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s good&mdash;very good&mdash;your idea, Lord Peter? Very ingenious.
Too ingenious. The dock at the Old Bailey is peopled by
gentlemen who are too ingenious. Ha! Come to a bad end one
of these days, young man. Eh! Yes&mdash;well, now, Murbles, the
question here turns on the interpretation of the word &lsquo;issue&rsquo;&mdash;you
grasp that, eh, ha! Yes. Well, <i>you</i> seem to think it means
issue <i>ad infinitum</i>. How do you make that out, come now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I thought it did; I said I thought it might,&rdquo;
remonstrated Mr. Murbles, mildly. &ldquo;The general intention of
the Act appears to be to exclude any remote kin where the
common ancestor is further back than the grandparents&mdash;not
to cut off the descendants of the brothers and sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intention?&rdquo; snapped Mr. Towkington. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m astonished at
you, Murbles! The law has nothing to do with good intentions.
What does the Act <i>say</i>? It says, &lsquo;To the brothers and sisters of
the whole blood and their issue.&rsquo; Now, in the absence of any
new definition, I should say that the word is here to be construed
as before the Act it was construed on intestacy&mdash;in so
far, at any rate, as it refers to personal property, which I understand
the property in question to be, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t see that you and your great-niece have a
leg to stand on&mdash;come now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;but d&rsquo;you mind&mdash;I know lay
people are awful ignorant nuisances&mdash;but if you <i>would</i> be so
good as to explain what the beastly word did or does mean, it
would be frightfully helpful, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Well, it&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; said Mr. Towkington, graciously.
&ldquo;Before 1837&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queen Victoria, I know,&rdquo; said Peter, intelligently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so. At the time when Queen Victoria came to the
throne, the word &lsquo;issue&rsquo; had no legal meaning&mdash;no legal meaning
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surprise me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are too easily surprised,&rdquo; said Mr. Towkington. &ldquo;Many
words have no legal meaning. Others have a legal meaning
very unlike their ordinary meaning. For example, the word
&lsquo;daffy-down-dilly.&rsquo; It is a criminal libel to call a lawyer a daffy-down-dilly.
Ha! Yes, I advise you <i>never</i> to do such a thing.
No, I certainly advise you never to do it. Then again, words
which are quite meaningless in your ordinary conversation may
have a meaning in law. For instance, I might say to a young
man like yourself, &lsquo;You wish to leave such-and-such property
to so-and-so.&rsquo; And you would very likely reply, &lsquo;Oh, yes, absolutely&rsquo;&mdash;meaning
nothing in particular by that. But if you
were to write in your will, &lsquo;I leave such-and-such property to
so-and-so <i>absolutely</i>,&rsquo; then that word would bear a definite legal
meaning, and would condition your bequest in a certain manner,
and might even prove an embarrassment and produce
results very far from your actual intentions. Eh, ha! You see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Prior to 1837, the word &lsquo;issue&rsquo; meant nothing.
A grant &lsquo;to A. and his issue&rsquo; merely gave A. a life estate. Ha!
But this was altered by the Wills Act of 1837.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as a will was concerned,&rdquo; put in Mr. Murbles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely. After 1837, in a will, &lsquo;issue&rsquo; meant &lsquo;heirs of the
body&rsquo;&mdash;that is to say, &lsquo;issue <i>ad infinitum</i>.&rsquo; In a deed, on the
other hand, &lsquo;issue&rsquo; retained its old meaning&mdash;or lack of meaning,
eh, ha! You follow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles, &ldquo;and on intestacy of personal
property&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am coming to that,&rdquo; said Mr. Towkington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;the word &lsquo;issue&rsquo; continued to mean &lsquo;heirs of the body,&rsquo;
and that held good till 1926.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Mr. Towkington, &ldquo;issue of the child or children
of the deceased certainly meant &lsquo;issue <i>ad infinitum&rsquo;&mdash;but</i>&mdash;issue
of any person <i>not</i> a child of the deceased only meant
the child of that person and did not include other descendants.
And that undoubtedly held good till 1926. And since the new
Act contains no statement to the contrary, I think we must
presume that it continues to hold good. Ha! Come now! In
the case before us, you observe that the claimant is <i>not</i> the
child of the deceased nor issue of the child of the deceased;
nor is she the child of the deceased&rsquo;s sister. She is merely the
grandchild of the deceased sister of the deceased. Accordingly,
I think she is debarred from inheriting under the new Act, eh?
ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see your point,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;And moreover,&rdquo; went on Mr. Towkington, &ldquo;after 1925,
&lsquo;issue&rsquo; in a will or deed does <i>not mean</i> &lsquo;issue <i>ad infinitum</i>.&rsquo;
That at least is clearly stated, and the Wills Act of 1837 is
revoked on that point. Not that that has any direct bearing on
the question. But it may be an indication of the tendency of
modern interpretation, and might possibly affect the mind of
the court in deciding how the word &lsquo;issue&rsquo; was to be construed
for the purposes of the new Act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles, &ldquo;I bow to your superior knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; broke in Parker, &ldquo;any uncertainty in the
matter would provide as good a motive for murder as the certainty
of exclusion from inheritance. If Mary Whittaker only
<i>thought</i> she might lose the money in the event of her great-aunt&rsquo;s
surviving into 1926, she might quite well be tempted to
polish her off a little earlier, and make sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shrewd, very shrewd, ha!&rdquo; added Mr. Towkington. &ldquo;But
you realise that all this theory of yours depends on Mary Whittaker&rsquo;s
having known about the new Act and its probable consequences
as early as October, 1925, eh, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why she shouldn&rsquo;t&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;I
remember reading an article in the <i>Evening Banner</i>, I think it
was, some months earlier&mdash;about the time when the Act was
having its second reading. That&rsquo;s what put the thing into my
head&mdash;I was trying to remember all evening where I&rsquo;d seen
that thing about washing out the long-lost heir, you know.
Mary Whittaker may easily have seen it too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;d probably have taken advice about it if she
did,&rdquo; said Mr. Murbles. &ldquo;Who is her usual man of affairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wimsey shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d have asked him,&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;Not
if she was wise, that is. You see, if she did, and he said she
probably wouldn&rsquo;t get anything unless Miss Dawson either made
a will or died before January, 1926, and if after that the old
lady did unexpectedly pop off in October, 1925, wouldn&rsquo;t the
solicitor-johnnie feel inclined to ask questions? It wouldn&rsquo;t be
safe, don&rsquo;t y&rsquo;know. I &rsquo;xpect she went to some stranger and asked
a few innocent little questions under another name, what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; said Mr. Towkington. &ldquo;You show a remarkable
disposition for crime, don&rsquo;t you, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I did go in for it, I&rsquo;d take reasonable precautions,&rdquo;
retorted Wimsey. &ldquo;&rsquo;S wonderful, of course, the tomfool things
murderers <i>do</i> do. But I have the highest opinion of Miss Whittaker&rsquo;s
brains. I bet she covered her tracks pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think Mr. Probyn mentioned the matter,&rdquo; suggested
Parker, &ldquo;the time he went down and tried to get Miss
Dawson to make her will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>don&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; said Wimsey, with energy, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m pretty certain
he tried to explain matters to the old lady, only she was so
terrified of the very idea of a will she wouldn&rsquo;t let him get a
word in. But I fancy old Probyn was too downy a bird to tell
the heir that her only chance of gettin&rsquo; the dollars was to see
that her great-aunt died off before the Act went through. Would
<i>you</i> tell anybody that, Mr. Towkington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I knew it,&rdquo; said that gentleman, grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be highly undesirable,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Murbles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;we can easily find out. Probyn&rsquo;s
in Italy&mdash;I was going to write to him, but perhaps you&rsquo;d better
do it, Murbles. And, in the meanwhile, Charles and I will
think up a way to find whoever it was that did give Miss Whittaker
an opinion on the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not forgetting, I suppose,&rdquo; said Parker, rather dryly,
&ldquo;that before pinning down a murder to any particular motive,
it is usual to ascertain that a murder has been committed? So
far, all we know is that, after a careful post-mortem analysis,
two qualified doctors have agreed that Miss Dawson died a
natural death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t keep on saying the same thing,
Charles. It bores me so. It&rsquo;s like the Raven never flitting which,
as the poet observes, still is sitting, still is sitting, inviting one
to heave the pallid bust of Pallas at him and have done with
it. You wait till I publish my epoch-making work: <i>The Murderer&rsquo;s
Vade-Mecum, or 101 Ways of Causing Sudden Death</i>.
That&rsquo;ll show you I&rsquo;m not a man to be trifled with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>But he saw the Chief Commissioner next morning and
reported that he was at last disposed to take the Dawson case
seriously.</p>

</div>
<p class="tb">As Parker came out from the Chief Commissioner&rsquo;s room, he
was caught by an officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a lady on the &rsquo;phone to you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
told her to ring up at 10:30. It&rsquo;s about that now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Mrs. Forrest. She wouldn&rsquo;t say what she wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd,&rdquo; thought Parker. His researches in the matter had
been so unfruitful that he had practically eliminated Mrs. Forrest
from the Gotobed mystery&mdash;merely keeping her filed, as
it were, in the back of his mind for future reference. It occurred
to him, whimsically, that she had at length discovered the
absence of one of her wine-glasses and was ringing him up
in a professional capacity. His conjectures were interrupted
by his being called to the telephone to answer Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s
call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Detective-Inspector Parker?&mdash;I&rsquo;m so sorry to trouble
you, but could you give me Mr. Templeton&rsquo;s address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Templeton?&rdquo; said Parker, momentarily puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it Templeton&mdash;the gentleman who came with you
to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;I&mdash;the matter
had slipped my memory. Er&mdash;you want his address?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have some information which I think he will be glad
to hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. You can speak quite freely to me, you know,
Mrs. Forrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>quite</i> freely,&rdquo; purred the voice at the other end of the
wire, &ldquo;you are rather official, you know. I should prefer just to
write to Mr. Templeton privately, and leave it to him to take
up with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Parker&rsquo;s brain worked briskly. It might be inconvenient
to have Mrs. Forrest writing to Mr. Templeton at 110<span class="small">A</span>,
Piccadilly. The letter might not be delivered. Or, if the lady
were to take it into her head to call and discovered that Mr.
Templeton was not known to the porter, she might take alarm
and bottle up her valuable information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;I ought not, perhaps, to give you
Mr. Templeton&rsquo;s address without consulting him. But you could
&rsquo;phone him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that would do. Is he in the book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but I can give you his private number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much. You&rsquo;ll forgive my bothering you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble at all.&rdquo; And he named Lord Peter&rsquo;s number.</p>
<p>Having rung off, he waited a moment and then called the
number himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Wimsey,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a call from Mrs.
Forrest. She wants to write to you. I wouldn&rsquo;t give the address,
but I&rsquo;ve given her your number, so if she calls and asks for Mr.
Templeton, you will remember who you are, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righty-ho! Wonder what the fair lady wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably occurred to her that she might have told a
better story, and she wants to work off a few additions and
improvements on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll probably give herself away. The rough sketch
is frequently so much more convincing than the worked-up
canvas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so. I couldn&rsquo;t get anything out of her myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. I expect she&rsquo;s thought it over and decided that it&rsquo;s
rather unusual to employ Scotland Yard to ferret out the whereabouts
of errant husbands. She fancies there&rsquo;s something up,
and that I&rsquo;m a nice soft-headed imbecile whom she can easily
pump in the absence of the official Cerberus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. Well, you&rsquo;ll deal with the matter. I&rsquo;m going to
make a search for that solicitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a vague sort of search, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got an idea which may work out. I&rsquo;ll let you
know if I get any results.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s call duly came through in about twenty
minutes&rsquo; time. Mrs. Forrest had changed her mind. Would
Mr. Templeton come round and see her that evening&mdash;about
9 o&rsquo;clock, if that was convenient? She had thought the matter
over and preferred not to put her information on paper.</p>
<p>Mr. Templeton would be very happy to come round. He
had no other engagement. It was no inconvenience at all. He
begged Mrs. Forrest not to mention it.</p>
<p>Would Mr. Templeton be so very good as not to tell anybody
about his visit? Mr. Forrest and his sleuths were continually
on the watch to get Mrs. Forrest into trouble, and the
decree absolute was due to come up in a month&rsquo;s time. Any
trouble with the King&rsquo;s Proctor would be positively disastrous.
It would be better if Mr. Templeton would come by Underground
to Bond Street, and proceed to the flats on foot, so as
not to leave a car standing outside the door or put a taxi-driver
into a position to give testimony against Mrs. Forrest.</p>
<p>Mr. Templeton chivalrously promised to obey these directions.</p>
<p>Mrs. Forrest was greatly obliged, and would expect him
at nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bunter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going out to-night. I&rsquo;ve been asked not to say where,
so I won&rsquo;t. On the other hand, I&rsquo;ve got a kind of feelin&rsquo; that
it&rsquo;s unwise to disappear from mortal ken, so to speak. Anything
might happen. One might have a stroke, don&rsquo;t you know. So
I&rsquo;m going to leave the address in a sealed envelope. If I don&rsquo;t
turn up before to-morrow mornin&rsquo;, I shall consider myself
absolved from all promises, what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I&rsquo;m not to be found at that address, there wouldn&rsquo;t
be any harm in tryin&rsquo;&mdash;say Epping Forest, or Wimbledon
Common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, you made the photographs of those finger-prints
I brought you some time ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because possibly Mr. Parker may be wanting them presently
for some inquiries he will be making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite understand, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing whatever to do with my excursion to-night, you
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you might bring me Christie&rsquo;s catalogue. I shall
be attending a sale there and lunching at the club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, detaching his mind from crime, Lord Peter bent his
intellectual and financial powers to outbidding and breaking a
ring of dealers, an exercise very congenial to his mischievous
spirit.</p>
<p class="tb">Lord Peter duly fulfilled the conditions imposed upon
him, and arrived on foot at the block of flats in South Audley
Street. Mrs. Forrest, as before, opened the door to him herself.
It was surprising, he considered, that, situated as she was, she
appeared to have neither maid nor companion. But then, he
supposed, a chaperon, however disarming of suspicion in the
eyes of the world, might prove venal. On the whole, Mrs.
Forrest&rsquo;s principle was a sound one: no accomplices. Many
transgressors, he reflected, had</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">&ldquo;<i>died because they never knew</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>These simple little rules and few.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Forrest apologised prettily for the inconvenience to
which she was putting Mr. Templeton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I never know when I am not spied upon,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;It is sheer spite, you know. Considering how my husband has
behaved to me, I think it is monstrous&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her guest agreed that Mr. Forrest must be a monster,
jesuitically, however, reserving the opinion that the monster
might be a fabulous one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you will be wondering why I have brought you
here,&rdquo; went on the lady. &ldquo;Do come and sit on the sofa. Will
you have whisky or coffee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Forrest, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve had an idea
since I saw you. I&mdash;you know, having been much in the same
position myself&rdquo; (with a slight laugh) &ldquo;I felt <i>so much</i> for your
friend&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvia,&rdquo; put in Lord Peter with commendable promptitude.
&ldquo;Oh, yes. Shocking temper and so on, but possibly some
provocation. Yes, yes, quite. Poor woman. Feels things&mdash;extra
sensitive&mdash;highly-strung and all that, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo; Mrs. Forrest nodded her fantastically turbanned
head. Swathed to the eyebrows in gold tissue, with
only two flat crescents of yellow hair plastered over her cheek-bones,
she looked, in an exotic smoking-suit of embroidered
tissue, like a young prince out of the Arabian Nights. Her
heavily ringed hands busied themselves with the coffee-cups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I felt that your inquiries were really serious, you
know, and though, as I told you, it had nothing to do with
me, I was interested and mentioned the matter in a letter to&mdash;to
my friend, you see, who was with me that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Wimsey, taking the cup from her, &ldquo;yes&mdash;er&mdash;that
was very&mdash;er&mdash;it was kind of you to be interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;my friend&mdash;is abroad at the moment. My letter
had to follow him, and I only got his reply to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Forrest took a sip or two of coffee as though to clear
her recollection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;His letter rather surprised me. He reminded me that after
dinner he had felt the room rather close, and had opened the
sitting-room window&mdash;that window, there&mdash;which overlooks
South Audley Street. He noticed a car standing there&mdash;a small
closed one, black or dark blue or some such colour. And while
he was looking idly at it&mdash;the way one does, you know&mdash;he
saw a man and woman come out of this block of flats&mdash;not
this door, but one or two along to the left&mdash;and get in and
drive off. The man was in evening dress and he thought it
might have been your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter, with his coffee-cup at his lips, paused and
listened with great attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the girl in evening dress, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;that struck my friend particularly. She was in just
a plain little dark suit, with a hat on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter recalled to mind as nearly as possible Bertha
Gotobed&rsquo;s costume. Was this going to be real evidence at last?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&mdash;that&rsquo;s very interesting,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I suppose
your friend couldn&rsquo;t give any more exact details of the dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Forrest, regretfully, &ldquo;but he said the
man&rsquo;s arm was round the girl as though she was feeling tired
or unwell, and he heard him say, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;the fresh air
will do you good.&rsquo; But you&rsquo;re not drinking your coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;&rdquo; Wimsey recalled himself with a
start. &ldquo;I was dreamin&rsquo;&mdash;puttin&rsquo; two and two together, as you
might say. So he was along here at the time&mdash;the artful beggar.
Oh, the coffee. D&rsquo;you mind if I put this away and have some
without sugar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> sorry. Men always seem to take sugar in black
coffee. Give it to me&mdash;I&rsquo;ll empty it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me.&rdquo; There was no slop-basin on the little table,
but Wimsey quickly got up and poured the coffee into the
window-box outside. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. How about another cup
for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you&mdash;I oughtn&rsquo;t to take it really, it keeps me awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if you like.&rdquo; She filled both cups and sat sipping
quietly. &ldquo;Well&mdash;that&rsquo;s all, really, but I thought perhaps I ought
to let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very good of you,&rdquo; said Wimsey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>They sat talking a little longer&mdash;about plays in Town (&ldquo;I
go out very little, you know, it&rsquo;s better to keep oneself out of
the limelight on these occasions&rdquo;), and books (&ldquo;I adore Michael
Arlen&rdquo;). Had she read <i>Young Men in Love</i> yet? No&mdash;she had
ordered it from the library. Wouldn&rsquo;t Mr. Templeton have
something to eat or drink? Really? A brandy? A liqueur?</p>
<p>No, thank you. And Mr. Templeton felt he really ought
to be slippin&rsquo; along now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;don&rsquo;t go yet&mdash;I get so lonely, these long evenings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a desperate kind of appeal in her voice. Lord
Peter sat down again.</p>
<p>She began a rambling and rather confused story about her
&ldquo;friend.&rdquo; She had given up so much for the friend. And now
that her divorce was really coming off, she had a terrible feeling
that perhaps the friend was not as affectionate as he used to
be. It was very difficult for a woman, and life was very hard.</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>As the minutes passed, Lord Peter became uncomfortably
aware that she was watching him. The words tumbled out&mdash;hurriedly,
yet lifelessly, like a set task, but her eyes were the
eyes of a person who expects something. Something alarming,
he decided, yet something she was determined to have. It
reminded him of a man waiting for an operation&mdash;keyed up
to it&mdash;knowing that it will do him good&mdash;yet shrinking from
it with all his senses.</p>
<p>He kept up his end of the fatuous conversation. Behind a
barrage of small-talk, his mind ran quickly to and fro, analysing
the position, getting the range.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Suddenly he became aware that she was trying&mdash;clumsily,
stupidly and as though in spite of herself&mdash;to get him to make
love to her.</p>
<p>The fact itself did not strike Wimsey as odd. He was rich
enough, well-bred enough, attractive enough and man of the
world enough to have received similar invitations fairly often
in his thirty-seven years of life. And not always from experienced
women. There had been those who sought experience
as well as those qualified to bestow it. But so awkward an
approach by a woman who admitted to already possessing a
husband and a lover was a phenomenon outside his previous
knowledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Moreover, he felt that the thing would be a nuisance. Mrs.
Forrest was handsome enough, but she had not a particle of
attraction for him. For all her make-up and her somewhat
outspoken costume, she struck him as spinsterish&mdash;even epicene.
That was the thing which puzzled him during their
previous interview. Parker&mdash;a young man of rigid virtue and
limited worldly knowledge&mdash;was not sensitive to these emanations.
But Wimsey had felt her as something essentially sexless,
even then. And he felt it even more strongly now. Never
had he met a woman in whom &ldquo;the great It,&rdquo; eloquently hymned
by Mrs. Elinor Glyn, was so completely lacking.</p>
<p>Her bare shoulder was against him now, marking his
broadcloth with white patches of powder.</p>
<p>Blackmail was the first explanation that occurred to him.
The next move would be for the fabulous Mr. Forrest, or
someone representing him, to appear suddenly in the doorway,
aglow with virtuous wrath and outraged sensibilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very pretty little trap,&rdquo; thought Wimsey, adding aloud,
&ldquo;Well, I really must be getting along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught him by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no caress in the touch&mdash;only a kind of desperation.</p>
<p>He thought, &ldquo;If she really made a practice of this, she
would do it better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to stay longer. It wouldn&rsquo;t be
safe for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>A passionate woman might have said it passionately. Or
with a brave gaiety. Or challengingly. Or alluringly. Or mysteriously.</p>
<p>She said it grimly. Her fingers dug at his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, damn it all, <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> risk it,&rdquo; thought Wimsey. &ldquo;I must
and will know what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little woman.&rdquo; He coaxed into his voice the throaty,
fatuous tone of the man who is preparing to make an amorous
fool of himself.</p>
<p>He felt her body stiffen as he slipped his arm round her,
but she gave a little sigh of relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>He pulled her suddenly and violently to him, and kissed
her mouth with a practised exaggeration of passion.</p>
<p>He knew then. No one who has ever encountered it can
ever again mistake that awful shrinking, that uncontrollable
revulsion of the flesh against a caress that is nauseous. He
thought for a moment that she was going to be actually sick.</p>
<p>He released her gently, and stood up&mdash;his mind in a whirl,
but somehow triumphant. His first instinct had been right,
after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very naughty of me,&rdquo; he said, lightly. &ldquo;You made
me forget myself. You will forgive me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded, shaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I really must toddle. It&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; frightfully late and
all that. Where&rsquo;s my hat? Ah, yes, in the hall. Now, good-bye,
Mrs. Forrest, an&rsquo; take care of yourself. An&rsquo; thank you ever so
much for telling me about what your friend saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are really going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke as though she had lost all hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; thought Wimsey, &ldquo;what does she want?
Does she suspect that Mr. Templeton is not everything that he
seems? Does she want me to stay the night so that she can get
a look at the laundry-mark on my shirt? Should I suddenly
save the situation for her by offering her Lord Peter Wimsey&rsquo;s
visiting-card?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His brain toyed freakishly with the thought as he babbled
his way to the door. She let him go without further words.</p>
<p>As he stepped into the hall he turned and looked at her.
She stood in the middle of the room, watching him, and on
her face was such a fury of fear and rage as turned his blood
to water.</p>

<br><span class="h2line2">A Cast-Iron Alibi</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oh, Sammy, Sammy, why vorn&rsquo;t there an alleybi?</i>&rdquo;
<span class="jr"><i>Pickwick Papers</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="tb">Miss Whittaker and the youngest Miss Findlater had returned
from their expedition. Miss Climpson, most faithful of sleuths,
and carrying Lord Peter&rsquo;s letter of instructions in the pocket of
her skirt like a talisman, had asked the youngest Miss Findlater
to tea.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Miss Climpson had become genuinely
interested in the girl. Silly affectation and gush, and a parrot-repetition
of the shibboleths of the modern school were symptoms
that the experienced spinster well understood. They indicated,
she thought, a real unhappiness, a real dissatisfaction
with the narrowness of life in a country town. And besides this,
Miss Climpson felt sure that Vera Findlater was being &ldquo;preyed
upon,&rdquo; as she expressed it to herself, by the handsome Mary
Whittaker. &ldquo;It would be a mercy for the girl,&rdquo; thought Miss
Climpson, &ldquo;if she could form a genuine attachment to a young
man. It is natural for a schoolgirl to be <i>schw&auml;rmerisch</i>&mdash;in a
young woman of twenty-two it is thoroughly undesirable. That
Whittaker woman encourages it&mdash;she would, of course. She
likes to have someone to admire her and run her errands. And
she prefers it to be a stupid person, who will not compete with
her. If Mary Whittaker were to marry, she would marry a
rabbit.&rdquo; (Miss Climpson&rsquo;s active mind quickly conjured up a
picture of the rabbit&mdash;fair-haired and a little paunchy, with a
habit of saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask the wife.&rdquo; Miss Climpson wondered
why Providence saw fit to create such men. For Miss Climpson,
men were intended to be masterful, even though wicked or
foolish. She was a spinster made and not born&mdash;a perfectly
womanly woman.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; thought Miss Climpson, &ldquo;Mary Whittaker is not of
the marrying sort. She is a professional woman by nature. She
has a profession, by the way, but she does not intend to go
back to it. Probably nursing demands too much sympathy&mdash;and
one is under the authority of the doctors. Mary Whittaker
prefers to control the lives of chicken. &lsquo;Better to reign in hell
than serve in heaven.&rsquo; Dear me! I wonder if it is uncharitable
to compare a fellow-being to Satan. Only in poetry, of course&mdash;I
daresay that makes it not so bad. At any rate, I am certain
that Mary Whittaker is doing Vera Findlater no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Climpson&rsquo;s guest was very ready to tell about their
month in the country. They had toured round at first for a few
days, and then they had heard of a delightful poultry farm
which was for sale, near Orpington in Kent. So they had gone
down to have a look at it, and found that it was to be sold in
about a fortnight&rsquo;s time. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been wise, of course,
to take it over without some inquiries, and by the greatest good
fortune they found a dear little cottage to let, furnished, quite
close by. So they had taken it for a few weeks, while Miss
Whittaker &ldquo;looked round&rdquo; and found out about the state of the
poultry business in that district, and so on. They <i>had</i> enjoyed
it so, and it was delightful keeping house together, right away
from all the silly people at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t mean you, Miss Climpson. You come
from London and are so much more broadminded. But I simply
can&rsquo;t stick the Leahampton lot, nor can Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very delightful,&rdquo; said Miss Climpson, &ldquo;to be <i>free</i> from
the conventions, I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;especially if one is in company
with a <i>kindred spirit</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;of course Mary and I are tremendous friends, though
she is so much cleverer than I am. It&rsquo;s absolutely settled that
we&rsquo;re to take the farm and run it together. Won&rsquo;t it be wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you find it rather dull and lonely&mdash;just you two
girls together? You mustn&rsquo;t forget that you&rsquo;ve been accustomed
to see quite a lot of young people in Leahampton. Shan&rsquo;t you
miss the tennis-parties, and the young men, and so on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! If you only knew what a stupid lot they are!
Anyway, I&rsquo;ve no use for men!&rdquo; Miss Findlater tossed her head.
&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t got any ideas. And they always look on women
as sort of pets or playthings. As if a woman like Mary wasn&rsquo;t
worth fifty of them! You should have heard that Markham man
the other day&mdash;talking politics to Mr. Tredgold, so that nobody
could get a word in edgeways, and then saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid this
is a very dull subject of conversation for you, Miss Whittaker,&rsquo;
in his condescending way. Mary said in that quiet way of hers,
&lsquo;Oh, I think the <i>subject</i> is anything but dull, Mr. Markham.&rsquo;
But he was so stupid, he couldn&rsquo;t even grasp that and said,
&lsquo;One doesn&rsquo;t expect ladies to be interested in politics, you know.
But perhaps you are one of the modern young ladies who want
the flapper&rsquo;s vote.&rsquo; Ladies, indeed! Why are men so insufferable
when they talk about ladies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think men are apt to be <i>jealous</i> of women,&rdquo; replied Miss
Climpson, thoughtfully, &ldquo;and jealousy <i>does</i> make people rather
<i>peevish</i> and <i>ill-mannered</i>. I suppose that when one would <i>like</i>
to despise a set of people and yet has a horrid suspicion that
one <i>can&rsquo;t</i> genuinely despise them, it makes one <i>exaggerate</i> one&rsquo;s
contempt for them in conversation. That is why, my dear, I
am always <i>very</i> careful not to speak sneeringly about men&mdash;even
though they <i>often deserve</i> it, you know. But if I did,
everybody would think I was an <i>envious old maid</i>, wouldn&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean to be an old maid, anyhow,&rdquo; retorted Miss
Findlater. &ldquo;Mary and I have quite decided that. We&rsquo;re interested
in things, not in men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a good start at finding out how it&rsquo;s going to
work,&rdquo; said Miss Climpson. &ldquo;Living with a person for a month
is an <i>excellent</i> test. I suppose you had somebody to do the
housework for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul. We did every bit of it, and it was great fun.
I&rsquo;m ever so good at scrubbing floors and laying fires and things,
and Mary&rsquo;s a simply marvellous cook. It was such a change
from having the servants always bothering round like they do
at home. Of course, it was quite a modern, labour-saving
cottage&mdash;it belongs to some theatrical people, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you do when you weren&rsquo;t inquiring into
the poultry business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we ran round in the car and saw places and attended
markets. Markets are frightfully amusing, with all the funny
old farmers and people. Of course, I&rsquo;d often been to markets
before, but Mary made it all so interesting&mdash;and then, too,
we were picking up hints all the time for our own marketing
later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you run up to Town at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought you&rsquo;d have taken the opportunity
for a little jaunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary hates Town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought <i>you</i> rather enjoyed a run up now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not keen. Not now. I used to think I was, but I expect
that was only the sort of spiritual restlessness one gets when
one hasn&rsquo;t an object in life. There&rsquo;s nothing in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Findlater spoke with the air of a disillusioned rake,
who has sucked life&rsquo;s orange and found it dead sea fruit. Miss
Climpson did not smile. She was accustomed to the r&ocirc;le of
confidante.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you were together&mdash;just you two&mdash;all the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every minute of it. And we weren&rsquo;t bored with one another
a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope your experiment will prove very successful,&rdquo; said
Miss Climpson. &ldquo;But when you really start on your life together,
don&rsquo;t you think it would be wise to arrange for a few <i>breaks</i> in
it? A little <i>change of companionship</i> is good for <i>everybody</i>. I&rsquo;ve
known so many <i>happy friendships</i> spoilt by people seeing <i>too
much</i> of one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t have been <i>real</i> friendships, then,&rdquo; asserted
the girl, dogmatically. &ldquo;Mary and I are <i>absolutely</i> happy together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said Miss Climpson, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t mind an <i>old
woman</i> giving you a word of warning, I should be inclined not
to keep the bow <i>always</i> bent. Suppose Miss Whittaker, for
instance, wanted to go off and have a day in Town on her own,
say&mdash;or go to stay with friends&mdash;you would have to learn not
to mind that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I shouldn&rsquo;t mind. Why&mdash;&rdquo; she checked herself.
&ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;m quite sure that Mary would be every bit as loyal
to me as I am to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Miss Climpson. &ldquo;The longer I live, my
dear, the more <i>certain</i> I become that <i>jealousy</i> is the most <i>fatal</i>
of feelings. The Bible calls it &lsquo;cruel as the grave,&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m sure
that is so. <i>Absolute</i> loyalty, without jealousy, is the essential
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Though naturally one would hate to think that the
person one was really friends with was putting another person
in one&rsquo;s place&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Miss Climpson, you do believe, don&rsquo;t you,
that a friendship ought to be &lsquo;fifty-fifty&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the ideal friendship, I suppose,&rdquo; said Miss Climpson,
thoughtfully, &ldquo;but I think it is a <i>very rare thing</i>. Among
women, that is. I doubt very much if I&rsquo;ve ever seen an example
of it. <i>Men</i>, I believe, find it easier to give and take in that
way&mdash;probably because they have so many outside interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men&rsquo;s friendships&mdash;oh yes! I know one hears a lot about
them. But half the time, I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re <i>real</i> friendships
at all. Men can go off for years and forget all about their friends.
And they don&rsquo;t really confide in one another. Mary and I tell
each other all our thoughts and feelings. Men seem just content
to think each other good sorts without ever bothering about
their inmost selves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably that&rsquo;s why their friendships last so well,&rdquo; replied
Miss Climpson. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t make such demands on one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a great friendship does make demands,&rdquo; cried Miss
Findlater eagerly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be just everything to one. It&rsquo;s
wonderful the way it seems to colour all one&rsquo;s thoughts. Instead
of being centred in oneself, one&rsquo;s centred in the other person.
That&rsquo;s what Christian love means&mdash;one&rsquo;s ready to die for the
other person.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Miss Climpson. &ldquo;I once heard
a sermon about that from a most <i>splendid</i> priest&mdash;and he said
that that kind of love might become <i>idolatry</i> if one wasn&rsquo;t very
careful. He said that Milton&rsquo;s remark about Eve&mdash;you know,
&lsquo;he for God only, she for God in him&rsquo;&mdash;was not congruous
with Catholic doctrine. One must get the <i>proportions</i> right,
and it was <i>out of proportion</i> to see everything through the eyes
of another fellow-creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One must put God first, of course,&rdquo; said Miss Findlater,
a little formally. &ldquo;But if the friendship is mutual&mdash;that was the
point&mdash;quite unselfish on both sides, it <i>must</i> be a good thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love is always good, when it&rsquo;s the <i>right kind</i>,&rdquo; agreed
Miss Climpson, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think it ought to be too <i>possessive</i>.
One has to <i>train</i> oneself&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated, and went on courageously&mdash;&ldquo;and
in any case, my dear, I cannot help feeling
that it is more natural&mdash;more proper, in a sense&mdash;for a man
and woman to be all in all to one another than for two persons
of the same sex. Er&mdash;after all, it is a&mdash;a <i>fruitful</i> affection,&rdquo;
said Miss Climpson, boggling a trifle at this idea, &ldquo;and&mdash;and
all that, you know, and I am sure that when the <i>right</i> MAN
comes along for you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother the right man!&rdquo; cried Miss Findlater, crossly. &ldquo;I
do hate that kind of talk. It makes one feel dreadful&mdash;like a
prize cow or something. Surely, we have got beyond that point
of view in these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Climpson perceived that she had let her honest zeal
outrun her detective discretion. She had lost the goodwill of
her informant, and it was better to change the conversation.
However, she could assure Lord Peter now of one thing.
Whoever the woman was that Mrs. Cropper had seen at Liverpool,
it was not Miss Whittaker. The attached Miss Findlater,
who had never left her friend&rsquo;s side, was sufficient guarantee
of that.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Letter from Mr. Probyn, retired Solicitor, of Villa Bianca, Fiesole,
to Mr. Marbles, Solicitor, of Staple Inn.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Private and confidential.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I was much interested in your letter relative to the death
of Miss Agatha Dawson, late of Leahampton, and will do my
best to answer your inquiries as briefly as possible, always, of
course, on the understanding that all information as to the
affairs of my late client will be treated as strictly confidential.
I make an exception, of course, in favor of the police officer
you mention in connection with the matter.</p>
<p>You wish to know (1) whether Miss Agatha Dawson was
aware that it might possibly prove necessary, under the provisions
of the new Act, for her to make a testamentary disposition,
in order to ensure that her great-niece, Miss Mary
Whittaker, should inherit her personal property. (2) Whether
I ever urged her to make this testamentary disposition and what
her reply was. (3) Whether I had made Miss Mary Whittaker
aware of the situation in which she might be placed, supposing
her great-aunt to die intestate later than December 31, 1925.</p>
<p>In the course of the Spring of 1925, my attention was
called by a learned friend to the ambiguity of the wording of
certain clauses in the Act, especially in respect of the failure
to define the precise interpretation to be placed on the word
&ldquo;Issue.&rdquo; I immediately passed in review the affairs of my various
clients, with a view to satisfying myself that the proper dispositions
had been made in each case to avoid misunderstanding
and litigation in case of intestacy. I at once realised that Miss
Whittaker&rsquo;s inheritance of Miss Dawson&rsquo;s property entirely depended
on the interpretation given to the clauses in question.
I was aware that Miss Dawson was extremely averse from making
a will, owing to that superstitious dread of decease which
we meet with so frequently in our profession. However, I thought
it my duty to make her understand the question and to do my
utmost to get a will signed. Accordingly, I went down to Leahampton
and laid the matter before her. This was on March
the 14th, or thereabouts&mdash;I am not certain to the precise day.</p>
<p>Unhappily, I encountered Miss Dawson at a moment when
her opposition to the obnoxious idea of making a will was at
its strongest. Her doctor had informed her that a further operation
would become necessary in the course of the next few
weeks, and I could have selected no more unfortunate occasion
for intruding the subject of death upon her mind. She resented
any such suggestion&mdash;there was a conspiracy, she declared, to
frighten her into dying under the operation. It appears that that
very tactless practitioner of hers had frightened her with a similar
suggestion before her previous operation. But she had come
through that and she meant to come through this, if only people
would not anger and alarm her.</p>
<p>Of course, if she <i>had</i> died under the operation, the whole
question would have settled itself and there would have been
no need of any will. I pointed out that the very reason why I
was anxious for the will to be made was that I fully expected
her to live on into the following years, and I explained the
provisions of the Act once more, as clearly as I could. She
retorted that in that case I had no business to come and trouble
her about the question at all. It would be time enough when
the Act was passed.</p>
<p>Naturally, the fool of a doctor had insisted that she was
not to be told what her disease was&mdash;they always do&mdash;and she
was convinced that the next operation would make all right
and that she would live for years. When I ventured to insist&mdash;giving
as my reason that we men of laws always preferred to
be on the safe and cautious side, she became exceedingly angry
with me, and practically ordered me out of the house. A few
days afterwards I received a letter from her, complaining of my
impertinence, and saying that she could no longer feel any
confidence in a person who treated her with such inconsiderate
rudeness. At her request, I forwarded all her private papers in
my possession to Mr. Hodgson, of Leahampton, and I have
not held any communication with any member of the family
since that date.</p>
<p>This answers your first and second questions. With regard
to the third: I certainly did not think it proper to inform Miss
Whittaker that her inheritance might depend upon her great-aunt&rsquo;s
either making a will or else dying before December 31,
1925. While I know nothing to the young lady&rsquo;s disadvantage,
I have always held it inadvisable that persons should know too
exactly how much they stand to gain by the unexpected decease
of other persons. In case of any unforeseen accident, the heirs
may find themselves in an equivocal position, where the fact
of their possessing such knowledge might&mdash;if made public&mdash;be
highly prejudicial to their interests. The most that I thought
it proper to say was that if at any time Miss Dawson should
express a wish to see me, I should like to be sent for without
delay. Of course, the withdrawal of Miss Dawson&rsquo;s affairs from
my hands put it out of my power to interfere any further.</p>
<p>In October 1925, feeling that my health was not what it
had been, I retired from business and came to Italy. In this
country the English papers do not always arrive regularly, and
I missed the announcement of Miss Dawson&rsquo;s death. That it
should have occurred so suddenly and under circumstances
somewhat mysterious, is certainly interesting.</p>
<p>You say further that you would be glad of my opinion on
Miss Agatha Dawson&rsquo;s mental condition at the time when I
last saw her. It was perfectly clear and competent&mdash;in so far
as she was ever competent to deal with business. She was in
no way gifted to grapple with legal problems, and I had extreme
difficulty in getting her to understand what the trouble was
with regard to the new Property Act. Having been brought up
all her life to the idea that property went of right to the next
of kin, she found it inconceivable that this state of things should
ever alter. She assured me that the law would never permit the
Government to pass such an Act. When I had reluctantly
persuaded her that it would, she was quite sure that no court
would be wicked enough to interpret the Act so as to give the
money to anybody but Miss Whittaker, when she was clearly
the proper person to have it. &ldquo;Why should the Duchy of Lancaster
have any right to it?&rdquo; she kept on saying. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even
know the Duke of Lancaster.&rdquo; She was not a particularly sensible
woman, and in the end I was not at all sure that I had
made her comprehend the situation&mdash;quite apart from the
dislike she had of pursuing the subject. However, there is no
doubt that she was then quite <i>compos mentis</i>. My reason for
urging her to make the will before her final operation was, of
course, that I feared she might subsequently lose the use of
her faculties, or&mdash;which comes to the same thing from a business
point of view&mdash;might have to be kept continually under
the influence of opiates.</p>
<p>Trusting that you will find here the information you require,</p>
<p><span class="center">I remain,</span>
<span class="center"><span class="hst">Yours faithfully,</span></span>
<span class="jr">Thos. Probyn.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Murbles read this letter through twice, very thoughtfully.
To even his cautious mind, the thing began to look like
the makings of a case. In his neat, elderly hand, he wrote a
little note to Detective-Inspector Parker, begging him to call
at Staple Inn at his earliest convenience.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker, however, was experiencing nothing at that
moment but inconvenience. He had been calling on solicitors
for two whole days, and his soul sickened at the sight of a brass
plate. He glanced at the long list in his hand, and distastefully
counted up the scores of names that still remained unticked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Parker was one of those methodical, painstaking people
whom the world could so ill spare. When he worked with
Wimsey on a case, it was an understood thing that anything
lengthy, intricate, tedious and soul-destroying was done by Parker.
He sometimes felt that it was irritating of Wimsey to take
this so much for granted. He felt so now. It was a hot day. The
pavements were dusty. Pieces of paper blew about the streets.
Buses were grilling outside and stuffy inside. The Express Dairy,
where Parker was eating a hurried lunch, seemed full of the
odours of fried plaice and boiling tea-urns. Wimsey, he knew,
was lunching at his club, before running down with Freddy
Arbuthnot to see the New Zealanders at somewhere or other.
He had seen him&mdash;a vision of exquisite pale grey, ambling
gently along Pall Mall. Damn Wimsey! Why couldn&rsquo;t he have
let Miss Dawson rest quietly in her grave? There she was, doing
no harm to anybody&mdash;and Wimsey must insist on prying into
her affairs and bringing the inquiry to such a point that Parker
simply had to take official notice of it. Oh well! he supposed
he must go on with these infernal solicitors.</p>
<p>He was proceeding on a system of his own, which might
or might not prove fruitful. He had reviewed the subject of the
new Property Act, and decided that if and when Miss Whittaker
had become aware of its possible effect on her own expectations,
she would at once consider taking legal advice.</p>
<p>Her first thought would no doubt be to consult a solicitor
in Leahampton, and unless she already had the idea of foul
play in her mind, there was nothing to deter her from doing
so. Accordingly, Parker&rsquo;s first move had been to run down to
Leahampton and interview the three firms of solicitors there.
All three were able to reply quite positively that they had never
received such an inquiry from Miss Whittaker, or from anybody,
during the year 1925. One solicitor, indeed&mdash;the senior
partner of Hodgson &amp; Hodgson, to whom Miss Dawson had
entrusted her affairs after her quarrel with Mr. Probyn&mdash;looked
a little oddly at Parker when he heard the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you, Inspector,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that if the point had
been brought to my notice in such a way, I should certainly
have remembered it, in the light of subsequent events.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;The matter never crossed your mind, I suppose,&rdquo; said
Parker, &ldquo;when the question arose of winding up the estate and
proving Miss Whittaker&rsquo;s claim to inherit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say it did. Had there been any question of searching
for next-of-kin it might&mdash;I don&rsquo;t say it would&mdash;have occurred
to me. But I had a very clear history of the family connections
from Mr. Probyn, the death took place nearly two months
before the Act came into force, and the formalities all went
through more or less automatically. In fact, I never thought
about the Act one way or another in that connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker said he was not surprised to hear it, and favoured
Mr. Hodgson with Mr. Towkington&rsquo;s learned opinion on the
subject, which interested Mr. Hodgson very much. And that
was all he got at Leahampton, except that he fluttered Miss
Climpson very much by calling upon her and hearing all about
her interview with Vera Findlater. Miss Climpson walked to
the station with him, in the hope that they might meet Miss
Whittaker&mdash;&ldquo;I am sure you would be <i>interested</i> to <i>see</i> her&rdquo;&mdash;but
they were unlucky. On the whole, thought Parker, it might
be just as well. After all, though he would like to see Miss
Whittaker, he was not particularly keen on her seeing him,
especially in Miss Climpson&rsquo;s company. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said
to Miss Climpson, &ldquo;you had better explain me in some way to
Mrs. Budge, or she may be a bit inquisitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I <i>have</i>,&rdquo; replied Miss Climpson, with an engaging
giggle, &ldquo;when Mrs. Budge said there was a Mr. Parker to see
me, of course I realised at <i>once</i> that she mustn&rsquo;t know <i>who</i> you
were, so I said, quite quickly, &lsquo;Mr. Parker! Oh, that must be
my nephew Adolphus.&rsquo; You don&rsquo;t mind being Adolphus, do
you? It&rsquo;s funny, but that was the <i>only</i> name that came into my
mind at the moment. I can&rsquo;t <i>think</i> why, for I&rsquo;ve never known
an Adolphus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Climpson,&rdquo; said Parker, solemnly, &ldquo;you are a marvellous
woman, and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind even if you&rsquo;d called me
Marmaduke.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>So here he was, working out his second line of inquiry. If
Miss Whittaker did not go to a Leahampton solicitor, to whom
would she go? There was Mr. Probyn, of course, but he did
not think she would have selected him. She would not have
known him at Crofton, of course&mdash;she had never actually lived
with her great-aunts. She had met him the day he came down
to Leahampton to see Miss Dawson. He had not then taken
her into his confidence about the object of his visit, but she
must have known from what her aunt said that it had to do
with the making of a will. In the light of her new knowledge,
she would guess that Mr. Probyn had then had the Act in his
mind, and had not thought fit to trust her with the facts. If
she asked him now, he would probably reply that Miss Dawson&rsquo;s
affairs were no longer in his hands, and refer her to Mr. Hodgson.
And besides, if she asked the question and anything were
to happen&mdash;Mr. Probyn might remember it. No, she would
not have approached Mr. Probyn.</p>
<p>What then?</p>
<p>To the person who has anything to conceal&mdash;to the person
who wants to lose his identity as one leaf among the leaves of
a forest&mdash;to the person who asks no more than to pass by and
be forgotten, there is one name above others which promises
a haven of safety and oblivion. London. Where no one knows
his neighbour. Where shops do not know their customers.
Where physicians are suddenly called to unknown patients
whom they never see again. Where you may lie dead in your
house for months together unmissed and unnoticed till the gas-inspector
comes to look at the meter. Where strangers are
friendly and friends are casual. London, whose rather untidy
and grubby bosom is the repository of so many odd secrets.
Discreet, incurious and all-enfolding London.</p>
<p>Not that Parker put it that way to himself. He merely
thought, &ldquo;Ten to one she&rsquo;d try London. They mostly think
they&rsquo;re safer there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Whittaker knew London, of course. She had trained
at the Royal Free. That meant she would know Bloomsbury
better than any other district. For nobody knew better than
Parker how rarely Londoners move out of their own particular
little orbit. Unless, of course, she had at some time during her
time at the hospital been recommended to a solicitor in another
quarter, the chances were that she would have gone to a solicitor
in the Bloomsbury or Holborn district.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Unfortunately for Parker, this is a quarter which swarms
with solicitors. Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road, Gray&rsquo;s Inn itself, Bedford Row,
Holborn, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn&mdash;the brass plates grow all about as
thick as blackberries.</p>
<p>Which was why Parker was feeling so hot, tired and fed-up
that June afternoon.</p>
<p>With an impatient grunt he pushed away his eggy plate,
paid-at-the-desk-please, and crossed the road towards Bedford
Row, which he had marked down as his portion for the afternoon.</p>
<p>He started at the first solicitor&rsquo;s he came to, which happened
to be the office of one J. F. Trigg. He was lucky. The
youth in the outer office informed him that Mr. Trigg had just
returned from lunch, was disengaged, and would see him.
Would he walk in?</p>
<p>Mr. Trigg was a pleasant, fresh-faced man in his early
forties. He begged Mr. Parker to be seated and asked what he
could do for him.</p>
<p>For the thirty-seventh time, Parker started on the opening
gambit which he had devised to suit his purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am only temporarily in London, Mr. Trigg, and finding
I needed legal advice, I was recommended to you by a man I
met in a restaurant. He did give me his name, but it has escaped
me, and anyway, it&rsquo;s of no great importance, is it? The point
is this. My wife and I have come up to Town to see her great-aunt,
who is in a very bad way. In fact, she isn&rsquo;t expected to
live.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, the old lady has always been fond of my wife,
don&rsquo;t you see, and it has always been an understood thing that
Mrs. Parker was to come into her money when she died. It&rsquo;s
quite a tidy bit, and we have been&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say looking forward
to it, but in a kind of mild way counting on it as something
for us to retire upon later on. You understand. There aren&rsquo;t
any other relations at all, so, though the old lady has often
talked about making a will, we didn&rsquo;t worry much, one way
or the other, because we took it for granted my wife would
come in for anything there was. But we were talking about it
to a friend yesterday, and he took us rather aback by saying
that there was a new law or something, and that if my wife&rsquo;s
great-aunt hadn&rsquo;t made a will we shouldn&rsquo;t get anything at all.
I think he said it would all go to the Crown. I didn&rsquo;t think that
could be right and told him so, but my wife is a bit nervous&mdash;there
are the children to be considered, you see&mdash;and she
urged me to get legal advice, because her great-aunt may go
off at any minute, and we don&rsquo;t know whether there is a will
or not. Now, how does a great-niece stand under the new
arrangements?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point has not been made very clear,&rdquo; said Mr. Trigg,
&ldquo;but my advice to you is, to find out whether a will has been
made and if not, to get one made without delay if the testatrix
is capable of making one. Otherwise I think there is a very real
danger of your wife&rsquo;s losing her inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem quite familiar with the question,&rdquo; said Parker,
with a smile; &ldquo;I suppose you are always being asked it since
this new Act came in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;always.&rsquo; It is comparatively rare for a great-niece
to be left as sole next-of-kin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it? Well, yes, I should think it must be. Do you remember
being asked that question in the summer of 1925, Mr.
Trigg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A most curious expression came over the solicitor&rsquo;s face&mdash;it
looked almost like alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you ask that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need have no hesitation in answering,&rdquo; said Parker,
taking out his official card. &ldquo;I am a police officer and have a
good reason for asking. I put the legal point to you first as a
problem of my own, because I was anxious to have your professional
opinion first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Well, Inspector, in that case I suppose I am justified
in telling you all about it. I <i>was</i> asked that question in June,
1925.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the circumstances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearly. I am not likely to forget them&mdash;or rather, the
sequel to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds interesting. Will you tell the story in your
own way and with all the details you can remember?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Just a moment.&rdquo; Mr. Trigg put his head out
into the outer office. &ldquo;Badcock, I am engaged with Mr. Parker
and can&rsquo;t see anybody. Now, Mr. Parker, I am at your service.
Won&rsquo;t you smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker accepted the invitation and lit up his well-worn
briar, while Mr. Trigg, rapidly smoking cigarette after cigarette,
unfolded his remarkable story.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I who am given to novel-reading, how often have I gone
out with the doctor when the stranger has summoned
him to visit the unknown patient in the lonely house.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This Strange Adventure may lead, in a later
chapter, to the revealing of a mysterious crime.</i>&rdquo;
<span class="jr"><i>The Londoner</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Mr. Trigg, &ldquo;that it was on the 15th, or 16th
June, 1925, that a lady called to ask almost exactly the same
question that you have done&mdash;only that she represented herself
as inquiring on behalf of a friend whose name she did not
mention. Yes&mdash;I think I can describe her pretty well. She was
tall and handsome, with a very clear skin, dark hair and blue
eyes&mdash;an attractive girl. I remember that she had very fine
brows, rather straight, and not much colour in her face, and
she was dressed in something summery but very neat. I should
think it would be called an embroidered linen dress&mdash;I am not
an expert on those things&mdash;and a shady white hat of panama
straw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your recollection seems very clear,&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is; I have rather a good memory; besides, I saw her on
other occasions, as you shall hear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;At this first visit she told me&mdash;much as you did&mdash;that
she was only temporarily in Town, and had been casually
recommended to me. I told her that I should not like to answer
her question off-hand. The Act, you may remember, had only
recently passed its Final Reading, and I was by no means up
in it. Besides, from just skimming through it, I had convinced
myself that various important questions were bound to crop
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told the lady&mdash;Miss Grant was the name she gave, by
the way&mdash;that I should like to take counsel&rsquo;s opinion before
giving her any advice, and asked if she could call again the
following day. She said she could, rose and thanked me, offering
me her hand. In taking it, I happened to notice rather
an odd scar, running across the backs of all the fingers&mdash;rather
as though a chisel or something had slipped at some time. I
noticed it quite idly, of course, but it was lucky for me I did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Grant duly turned up the next day. I had looked up
a very learned friend in the interval, and gave her the same
opinion that I gave you just now. She looked rather concerned
about it&mdash;in fact, almost more annoyed than concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It seems rather unfair,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that people&rsquo;s family
money should go away to the Crown like that. After all, a great-niece
is quite a near relation, really.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I replied that, provided the great-niece could call witnesses
to prove that the deceased had always had the intention
of leaving her the money, the Crown would, in all probability,
allot the estate, or a suitable proportion of it, in accordance
with the wishes of the deceased. It would, however, lie entirely
within the discretion of the court to do so or not, and, of
course, if there had been any quarrel or dispute about the matter
at any time, the judge might take an unfavourable view of the
great-niece&rsquo;s application.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In any case,&rsquo; I added, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>know</i> that the great-niece
is excluded under the Act&mdash;I only understand that she <i>may</i>
be. In any case, there are still six months before the Act comes
into force, and many things may happen before then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You mean that Auntie may die,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but she&rsquo;s not
really dangerously ill&mdash;only mental, as Nurse calls it.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, she went away then after paying my fee, and I
noticed that the &lsquo;friend&rsquo;s great-aunt&rsquo; had suddenly become
&lsquo;Auntie,&rsquo; and decided that my client felt a certain personal
interest in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy she had,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;When did you see her
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oddly enough, I ran across her in the following December.
I was having a quick and early dinner in Soho, before
going on to a show. The little place I usually patronise was
very full, and I had to sit at a table where a woman was already
seated. As I muttered the usual formula about &lsquo;Was anybody
sitting there,&rsquo; she looked up, and I promptly recognised my
client.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, how do you do, Miss Grant?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; she replied, rather stiffly. &lsquo;I think you
are mistaken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I beg <i>your</i> pardon,&rsquo; said I, stiffer still, &lsquo;My name is Trigg,
and you came to consult me in Bedford Row last June. But if
I am intruding, I apologise and withdraw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She smiled then, and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I did not recognise
you for the moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I obtained permission to sit at her table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By way of starting a conversation, I asked whether she
had taken any further advice in the matter of the inheritance.
She said no, she had been quite content with what I had told
her. Still to make conversation, I inquired whether the great-aunt
had made a will after all. She replied, rather briefly, that
it had not been necessary; the old lady had died. I noticed that
she was dressed in black, and was confirmed in my opinion
that she herself was the great-niece concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We talked for some time, Inspector, and I will not conceal
from you that I found Miss Grant a very interesting personality.
She had an almost masculine understanding. I may say I am
not the sort of a man who prefers women to be brainless. No,
I am rather modern in that respect. If ever I was to take a wife,
Inspector, I should wish her to be an intelligent companion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Parker said Mr. Trigg&rsquo;s attitude did him great credit. He
also made the mental observation that Mr. Trigg would probably
not object to marrying a young woman who had inherited
money and was unencumbered with relations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is rare,&rdquo; went on Mr. Trigg, &ldquo;to find a woman with a
legal mind. Miss Grant was unusual in that respect. She took
a great interest in some case or other that was prominent in
the newspapers at the time&mdash;I forget now what it was&mdash;and
asked me some remarkably sensible and intelligent questions.
I must say that I quite enjoyed our conversation. Before dinner
was over, we had got on to more personal topics, in the course
of which I happened to mention that I lived in Golder&rsquo;s Green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she give you her own address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said she was staying at the Peveril Hotel in Bloomsbury,
and that she was looking for a house in Town. I said that
I might possibly hear of something out Hampstead way, and
offered my professional services in case she should require
them. After dinner I accompanied her back to her hotel, and
bade her good-bye in the lounge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was really staying there, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently. However, about a fortnight later, I happened
to hear of a house in Golder&rsquo;s Green that had fallen vacant
suddenly. It belonged, as a matter of fact, to a client of mine.
In pursuance of my promise, I wrote to Miss Grant at the
Peveril. Receiving no reply, I made inquiries there, and found
that she had left the hotel the day after our meeting, leaving
no address. In the hotel register, she had merely given her
address as Manchester. I was somewhat disappointed, but
thought no more about the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a month later&mdash;on January 26th, to be exact, I
was sitting at home reading a book, preparatory to retiring to
bed. I should say that I occupy a flat, or rather maisonette, in
a small house which has been divided to make two establishments.
The people on the ground floor were away at that time,
so that I was quite alone in the house. My housekeeper only
comes in by the day. The telephone rang&mdash;I noticed the time.
It was a quarter to eleven. I answered it, and a woman&rsquo;s voice
spoke, begging me to come instantly to a certain house on
Hampstead Heath, to make a will for someone who was at the
point of death.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you recognise the voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It sounded like a servant&rsquo;s voice. At any rate, it had
a strong cockney accent. I asked whether to-morrow would not
be time enough, but the voice urged me to hurry or it might
be too late. Rather annoyed, I put my things on and went out.
It was a most unpleasant night, cold and foggy. I was lucky
enough to find a taxi on the nearest rank. We drove to the
address, which we had great difficulty in finding, as everything
was pitch-black. It turned out to be a small house in a very
isolated position on the Heath&mdash;in fact, there was no proper
approach to it. I left the taxi on the road, about a couple of
hundred yards off, and asked the man to wait for me, as I was
very doubtful of ever finding another taxi in that spot at that
time of night. He grumbled a good deal, but consented to wait
if I promised not to be very long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made my way to the house. At first I thought it was
quite dark, but presently I saw a faint glimmer in a ground-floor
room. I rang the bell. No answer, though I could hear
it trilling loudly. I rang again and knocked. Still no answer. It
was bitterly cold. I struck a match to be sure I had come to
the right house, and then I noticed that the front door was
ajar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that perhaps the servant who had called me
was so much occupied with her sick mistress as to be unable
to leave her to come to the door. Thinking that in that case I
might be of assistance to her, I pushed the door open and went
in. The hall was perfectly dark, and I bumped against an umbrella-stand
in entering. I thought I heard a faint voice calling
or moaning, and when my eyes had become accustomed to
the darkness, I stumbled forward, and saw a dim light coming
from a door on the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that the room which you had seen to be illumined
from outside?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. I called out, &lsquo;May I come in?&rsquo; and a very low,
weak voice replied, &lsquo;Yes, please.&rsquo; I pushed the door open and
entered a room furnished as a sitting-room. In one corner there
was a couch, on which some bed-clothes appeared to have
been hurriedly thrown to enable it to be used as a bed. On the
couch lay a woman, all alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could only dimly make her out. There was no light in
the room except a small oil-lamp, with a green shade so tilted
as to keep the light from the sick woman&rsquo;s eyes. There was a
fire in the grate, but it had burnt low. I could see, however,
that the woman&rsquo;s head and face were swathed in white bandages.
I put out my hand and felt for the electric switch, but
she called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No light, please&mdash;it hurts me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she see you put your hand to the switch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Trigg, &ldquo;that was an odd thing. She didn&rsquo;t
speak, as a matter of fact, till I had actually clicked the switch
down. But nothing happened. The light didn&rsquo;t come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I supposed that the bulb had been taken away or had
gone phut. However, I said nothing, and came up to the bed.
She said in a sort of half-whisper, &lsquo;Is that the lawyer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and asked what I could do for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;I have had a terrible accident. I can&rsquo;t live. I
want to make my will quickly.&rsquo; I asked whether there was
nobody with her. &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; she said in a hurried way, &lsquo;my
servant will be back in a moment. She has gone to look for a
doctor.&rsquo; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t she have rung up? You are not
fit to be left alone.&rsquo; &lsquo;We couldn&rsquo;t get through to one,&rsquo; she
replied, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all right. She will be here soon. Don&rsquo;t waste time.
I must make my will.&rsquo; She spoke in a dreadful, gasping way,
and I felt that the best thing would be to do what she wanted,
for fear of agitating her. I drew a chair to the table where the
lamp was, got out my fountain pen and a printed will-form
with which I had provided myself, and expressed myself ready
to receive her instructions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Before beginning, she asked me to give her a little brandy
and water from a decanter which stood on the table. I did so,
and she took a small sip, which seemed to revive her. I placed
the glass near her hand, and at her suggestion mixed another
glass for myself. I was very glad of it, for, as I said, it was a
beast of a night, and the room was cold. I looked round for
some extra coals to put on the fire, but could see none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;is extremely interesting and suggestive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it queer at the time. But the whole thing was
queer. Anyway, I then said I was ready to begin. She said, &lsquo;You
may think I am a little mad, because my head has been so
hurt. But I am quite sane. But he shan&rsquo;t have a penny of the
money.&rsquo; I asked her if someone had attacked her. She replied,
&lsquo;My husband. He thinks he has killed me. But I am going to
live long enough to will the money away.&rsquo; She then said that
her name was Mrs. Marion Mead, and proceeded to make a
will, leaving her estate, which amounted to about &pound;10,000,
among various legatees, including a daughter and three or four
sisters. It was rather a complicated will, as it included various
devices for tying up the daughter&rsquo;s money in a trust, so as to
prevent her from ever handing over any of it to the father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you make a note of the names and addresses of the
people involved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, but, as you will see later on, I could make no use
of them. The testatrix was certainly clear-headed enough about
the provisions of the will, though she seemed terribly weak,
and her voice never rose above a whisper after that one time
when she had called to me not to turn on the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length I finished my notes of the will, and started to
draft it out on to the proper form. There were no signs of the
servant&rsquo;s return, and I began to be really anxious. Also the
extreme cold&mdash;or something else&mdash;added to the fact that it
was now long past my bed-time, was making me appallingly
sleepy. I poured out another stiff little dose of the brandy to
warm me up, and went on writing out the will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I had finished I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How about signing this? We need another witness to
make it legal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;My servant must be here in a minute or two.
I can&rsquo;t think what has happened to her.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I expect she has missed her way in the fog,&rsquo; I said.
&lsquo;However, I will wait a little longer. I can&rsquo;t go and leave you
like this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thanked me feebly, and we sat for some time in
silence. As time went on, I began to feel the situation to be
increasingly uncanny. The sick woman breathed heavily, and
moaned from time to time. The desire for sleep overpowered
me more and more. I could not understand it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently it occurred to me, stupefied though I felt, that
the most sensible thing would be to get the taxi-man&mdash;if he
was still there&mdash;to come in and witness the will with me, and
then to go myself to find a doctor. I sat, sleepily revolving this
in my mind, and trying to summon energy to speak. I felt as
though a great weight of inertia was pressing down upon me.
Exertion of any kind seemed almost beyond my powers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly something happened which brought me back
to myself. Mrs. Mead turned a little over upon the couch and
peered at me intently, as it seemed, in the lamp-light. To
support herself, she put both her hands on the edge of the
table. I noticed, with a vague sense of something unexpected,
that the left hand bore no wedding-ring. And then I noticed
something else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Across the back of the fingers of the right hand went a
curious scar&mdash;as though a chisel or some such thing had slipped
and cut them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker sat upright in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Trigg, &ldquo;that interests you. It startled me.
Or rather, startled isn&rsquo;t quite the word. In my oppressed state,
it affected me like some kind of nightmare. I struggled upright
in my chair, and the woman sank back upon her pillows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that moment there came a violent ring at the bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The servant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;thank Heaven it was my taxi-driver, who had become
tired of waiting. I thought&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite know what I
thought&mdash;but I was alarmed. I gave some kind of shout or
groan, and the man came straight in. Happily, I had left the
door open as I had found it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;I pulled myself together sufficiently to ask him to witness
the will. I must have looked queer and spoken in a strange
way, for I remember how he looked from me to the brandy-bottle.
However, he signed the paper after Mrs. Mead, who
wrote her name in a weak, straggling hand as she lay on her
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wot next, guv&rsquo;nor?&rsquo; asked the man, when this was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was feeling dreadfully ill by now. I could only say, &lsquo;Take
me home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked at Mrs. Mead and then at me, and said, &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t
there nobody to see to the lady, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Fetch a doctor. But take me home first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stumbled out of the house on his arm. I heard him
muttering something about its being a rum start. I don&rsquo;t remember
the drive home. When I came back to life, I was in
my own bed, and one of the local doctors was standing over
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid this story is getting very long and tedious. To
cut matters short, it seems the taxi-driver, who was a very
decent, intelligent fellow, had found me completely insensible
at the end of the drive. He didn&rsquo;t know who I was, but he
hunted in my pocket and found my visiting card and my latch-key.
He took me home, got me upstairs and, deciding that if
I was drunk, I was a worse drunk that he had ever encountered
in his experience, humanely went round and fetched a doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor&rsquo;s opinion was that I had been heavily drugged
with veronal or something of that kind. Fortunately, if the idea
was to murder me, the dose had been very much under-estimated.
We went into the matter thoroughly, and the upshot
was that I must have taken about 30 grains of the stuff. It
appears that it is a difficult drug to trace by analysis, but that
was the conclusion the doctor came to, looking at the matter
all round. Undoubtedly the brandy had been doped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we went round to look at the house next day.
It was all shut up, and the local milkman informed us that the
occupiers had been away for a week and were not expected
home for another ten days. We got into communication with
them, but they appeared to be perfectly genuine, ordinary people,
and they declared they knew nothing whatever about it.
They were accustomed to go away every so often, just shutting
the house and not bothering about a caretaker or anything.
The man came along at once, naturally, to investigate matters,
but couldn&rsquo;t find that anything had been stolen or disturbed,
except that a pair of sheets and some pillows showed signs of
use, and a scuttle of coal had been used in the sitting-room.
The coal-cellar, which also contained the electric meter, had
been left locked and the meter turned off before the family
left&mdash;they apparently had a few grains of sense&mdash;which accounts
for the chill darkness of the house when I entered it.
The visitor had apparently slipped back the catch of the pantry
window&mdash;one of the usual gimcrack affairs&mdash;with a knife or
something, and had brought her own lamp, siphon and brandy.
Daring, but not really difficult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Mrs. Mead or Miss Grant was to be heard of anywhere,
as I needn&rsquo;t tell you. The tenants of the house were
not keen to start expensive inquiries&mdash;after all, they&rsquo;d lost nothing
but a shilling&rsquo;s worth of coals&mdash;and on consideration, and
seeing that I hadn&rsquo;t actually been murdered or anything, I
thought it best to let the matter slide. It was a most unpleasant
adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it was. Did you ever hear from Miss Grant
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. She rang me up twice&mdash;once, after three
months, and again only a fortnight ago, asking for an appointment.
You may think me cowardly, Mr. Parker, but each time
I put her off. I didn&rsquo;t quite know what might happen. As a
matter of fact, the opinion I formed in my own mind was that
I had been entrapped into that house with the idea of making
me spend the night there and afterwards blackmailing me. That
was the only explanation I could think of which would account
for the sleeping-draught. I thought discretion was the better
part of valour, and gave my clerks and my housekeeper instructions
that if Miss Grant should call at any time I was out and
not expected back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m. Do you suppose she knew you had recognised the
scar on her hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she didn&rsquo;t. Otherwise she would hardly have
made advances to me in her own name again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. I think you are right. Well, Mr. Trigg, I am much
obliged to you for this information, which may turn out to be
very valuable. And if Miss Grant should ring you up again&mdash;where
did she call from, by the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From call-boxes, each time. I know that, because the
operator always tells one when the call is from a public box.
I didn&rsquo;t have the calls traced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. Well, if she does it again, will you
please make an appointment with her, and then let me know
about it at once? A call to Scotland Yard will always find me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Trigg promised that he would do this, and Parker took
his leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we know,&rdquo; thought Parker as he returned home,
&ldquo;that somebody&mdash;an odd unscrupulous somebody&mdash;was making
inquiries about great-nieces in 1925. A word to Miss Climpson,
I fancy, is indicated&mdash;just to find out whether Mary
Whittaker has a scar on her right hand, or whether I&rsquo;ve got to
hunt up any more solicitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hot streets seemed less oppressively oven-like than
before. In fact, Parker was so cheered by his interview that he
actually bestowed a cigarette-card upon the next urchin who
accosted him.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;You will not, I imagine, deny,&rdquo; observed Lord Peter, &ldquo;that
very odd things seem to happen to the people who are in a
position to give information about the last days of Agatha Dawson.
Bertha Gotobed dies suddenly, under suspicious circumstances;
her sister thinks she sees Miss Whittaker lying in wait
for her at Liverpool docks; Mr. Trigg is inveigled into a house
of mystery and is semi-poisoned. I wonder what would have
happened to Mr. Probyn, if he had been careless enough to
remain in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deny nothing,&rdquo; replied Parker. &ldquo;I will only point out to
you that during the month in which these disasters occurred
to the Gotobed family, the object of your suspicions was in
Kent with Miss Vera Findlater, who never left her side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As against that undoubted snag,&rdquo; rejoined Wimsey, &ldquo;I
bring forward a letter from Miss Climpson, in which&mdash;amid
a lot of rigmarole with which I will not trouble you&mdash;she
informs me that upon Miss Whittaker&rsquo;s right hand there is a
scar, precisely similar to the one which Mr. Trigg describes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there? That does seem to connect Miss Whittaker pretty
definitely with the Trigg business. But is it your theory that
she is trying to polish off all the people who know anything
about Miss Dawson? Rather a big job, don&rsquo;t you think, for a
single-handed female? And if so, why is Dr. Carr spared? and
Nurse Philliter? and Nurse Forbes? And the other doctor chappie?
And the rest of the population of Leahampton, if it comes
to that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an interesting point which had already occurred
to me. I think I know why. Up to the present, the Dawson
case has presented two different problems, one legal and one
medical&mdash;the motive and the means, if you like that better.
As far as opportunity goes, only two people figure as possibles&mdash;Miss
Whittaker and Nurse Forbes. The Forbes woman had
nothing to gain by killin&rsquo; a good patient, so for the moment
we can wash her out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, as to the medical problem&mdash;the means. I must
say that up to now that appears completely insoluble. I am
baffled, Watson (said he, his hawk-like eyes gleaming angrily
from under the half-closed lids). Even I am baffled. But not
for long! (he cried, with a magnificent burst of self-confidence).
My Honour (capital H) is concerned to track this Human Fiend
(capitals) to its hidden source, and nail the whited sepulchre
to the mast even though it crush me in the attempt! Loud
applause. His chin sank broodingly upon his dressing-gown,
and he breathed a few guttural notes into the bass saxophone
which was the cherished companion of his solitary hours in
the bathroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker ostentatiously took up the book which he had laid
aside on Wimsey&rsquo;s entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me when you&rsquo;ve finished,&rdquo; he said, caustically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hardly begun. The means, I repeat, seems insoluble&mdash;and
so the criminal evidently thinks. There has been no
exaggerated mortality among the doctors and nurses. On that
side of the business the lady feels herself safe. No. The motive
is the weak point&mdash;hence the hurry to stop the mouths of the
people who knew about the legal part of the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see. Mrs. Cropper has started back to Canada, by
the way. She doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been molested at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;and that&rsquo;s why I still think there was somebody on
the watch in Liverpool. Mrs. Cropper was only worth silencing
so long as she had told nobody her story. That is why I was
careful to meet her and accompany her ostentatiously to Town.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, rot, Peter! Even if Miss Whittaker had been there&mdash;which
we know she couldn&rsquo;t have been&mdash;how was she to know
that you were going to ask about the Dawson business? She
doesn&rsquo;t know you from Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might have found out who Murbles was. The advertisement
which started the whole business was in his name,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, why hasn&rsquo;t she attacked Murbles or you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murbles is a wise old bird. In vain are nets spread in his
sight. He is seeing no female clients, answering no invitations,
and never goes out without an escort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he took it so seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Murbles is old enough to have learnt the value
of his own skin. As for me&mdash;have you noticed the remarkable
similarity in some ways between Mr. Trigg&rsquo;s adventure and my
own little adventurelet, as you might say, in South Audley
Street?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, with Mrs. Forrest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The secret appointment. The drink. The endeavour
to get one to stay the night at all costs. I&rsquo;m positive there was
something in that sugar, Charles, that no sugar should contain&mdash;see
Public Health (Adulteration of Food) Acts, various.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think Mrs. Forrest is an accomplice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. I don&rsquo;t know what she has to gain by it&mdash;probably
money. But I feel sure there is some connection. Partly because
of Bertha Gotobed&rsquo;s &pound;5 note; partly because Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s story
was a palpable fake&mdash;I&rsquo;m certain the woman&rsquo;s never had a
lover, let alone a husband&mdash;you can&rsquo;t mistake real inexperience;
and chiefly because of the similarity of method. Criminals
always tend to repeat their effects. Look at George Joseph Smith
and his brides. Look at Neill Cream. Look at Armstrong and
his tea-parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if there&rsquo;s an accomplice, all the better. Accomplices
generally end up by giving the show away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. And we are in a good position because up till now
I don&rsquo;t think they know that we suspect any connection between
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I still think, you know, we ought to get some evidence
that actual crimes have been committed. Call me finicking, if
you like. If you <i>could</i> suggest a means of doing away with these
people so as to leave no trace, I should feel happier about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The means, eh?&mdash;Well, we do know something about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;take the two victims&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alleged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, old particular. The two alleged victims and the
two (alleged) intended victims. Miss Dawson was ill and helpless;
Bertha Gotobed possibly stupefied by a heavy meal and
an unaccustomed quantity of wine; Trigg was given a sufficient
dose of veronal to send him to sleep, and I was offered something
of probably the same kind&mdash;I wish I could have kept the
remains of that coffee. So we deduce from that, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that it was a means of death which could only
be used on somebody more or less helpless or unconscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. As for instance, a hypodermic injection&mdash;only
nothing appears to have been injected. Or a delicate operation
of some kind&mdash;if we could only think of one to fit the case.
Or the inhalation of something&mdash;such as chloroform&mdash;only
we could find no traces of suffocation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That doesn&rsquo;t get us very far, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something. Then again, it may very well be something
that a trained nurse would have learnt or heard about. Miss
Whittaker was trained, you know&mdash;which, by the way, was
what made it so easy for her to bandage up her own head and
provide a pitiful and unrecognisable spectacle for the stupid
Mr. Trigg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have to be anything very out of the way&mdash;nothing,
I mean, that only a trained surgeon could do, or that
required very specialised knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Probably something picked up in conversation
with a doctor or the other nurses. I say, how about getting hold
of Dr. Carr again? Or, no&mdash;if he&rsquo;d got any ideas on the subject
he&rsquo;d have trotted &rsquo;em out before now. I know! I&rsquo;ll ask Lubbock,
the analyst. He&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll get in touch with him to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And meanwhile,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;I suppose we just sit round
and wait for somebody else to be murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beastly, isn&rsquo;t it? I still feel poor Bertha Gotobed&rsquo;s blood
on my head, so to speak. I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve practically got clear proof on the Trigg business.
Couldn&rsquo;t you put the lady in quod on a charge of burglary
while we think out the rest of the dope? It&rsquo;s often done. It <i>was</i>
a burglary, you know. She broke into a house after dark and
appropriated a scuttleful of coal to her own use. Trigg could
identify her&mdash;he seems to have paid the lady particular attention
on more than one occasion&mdash;and we could rake up his
taxi-man for corroborative detail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker pulled at his pipe for a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;I think perhaps
it&rsquo;s worth while putting it before the authorities. But we
mustn&rsquo;t be in too much of a hurry, you know. I wish we were
further ahead with our other proofs. There&rsquo;s such a thing as
Habeas Corpus&mdash;you can&rsquo;t hold on to people indefinitely just
on a charge of stealing coal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the breaking and entering, don&rsquo;t forget that. It&rsquo;s
burglary, after all. You can get penal servitude for life for burglary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it all depends on the view the law takes of the coal.
It might decide that there was no original intention of stealing
coal, and treat the thing as a mere misdemeanour or civil
trespass. Anyhow, we don&rsquo;t really <i>want</i> a conviction for stealing
coal. But I&rsquo;ll see what they think about it at our place, and
meanwhile I&rsquo;ll get hold of Trigg again and try and find the
taxi-driver. And Trigg&rsquo;s doctor. We might get it as an attempt
to murder Trigg, or at least to inflict grievous bodily harm. But
I should like some more evidence about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cuckoo! So should I. But I can&rsquo;t manufacture evidence
out of nothing. Dash it all, be reasonable. I&rsquo;ve built you up a
case out of nothing. Isn&rsquo;t that handsome enough? Base ingratitude&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s the matter with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Parker&rsquo;s inquiries took some time, and June lingered into
its longest days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Chamberlin and Levine flew the Atlantic, and Segrave
bade farewell to Brooklands. The <i>Daily Yell</i> wrote anti-Red
leaders and discovered a plot, somebody laid claim to a marquisate,
and a Czecho-Slovakian pretended to swim the Channel.
Hammond out-graced Grace, there was an outburst of
murder at Moscow, Foxlaw won the Gold Cup and the earth
opened at Oxhey and swallowed up somebody&rsquo;s front garden.
Oxford decided that women were dangerous, and the electric
hare consented to run at the White City. England&rsquo;s supremacy
was challenged at Wimbledon, and the House of Lords made
the gesture of stooping to conquer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lord Peter&rsquo;s projected <i>magnum opus</i> on a-hundred-and-one
ways of causing sudden death had advanced
by the accumulation of a mass of notes which flowed all over
the library at the flat, and threatened to engulf Bunter, whose
task it was to file and cross-reference and generally to produce
order from chaos. Oriental scholars and explorers were button-holed
in clubs and strenuously pumped on the subject of abstruse
native poisons; horrid experiments performed in German
laboratories were communicated in unreadable documents; and
the life of Sir James Lubbock, who had the misfortune to be
a particular friend of Lord Peter&rsquo;s, was made a burden to him
with daily inquiries as to the post-mortem detection of such
varying substances as chloroform, curate, hydrocyanic acid gas
and diethylsulphonmethylethylmetane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely there <i>must</i> be something which kills without
leaving a trace,&rdquo; pleaded Lord Peter, when at length informed
that the persecution must cease. &ldquo;A thing in such universal
demand&mdash;surely it is not beyond the wit of scientists to invent
it. It must exist. Why isn&rsquo;t it properly advertised? There ought
to be a company to exploit it. It&rsquo;s simply ridiculous. Why, it&rsquo;s
a thing one might be wantin&rsquo; one&rsquo;s self any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Sir James Lubbock. &ldquo;Plenty
of poisons leave no particular post-mortem appearances. And
plenty of them&mdash;especially the vegetable ones&mdash;are difficult
to find by analysis, unless you know what you are looking for.
For instance, if you&rsquo;re testing for arsenic, that test won&rsquo;t tell
you whether strychnine is present or not. And if you&rsquo;re testing
for strychnine, you won&rsquo;t find morphia. You&rsquo;ve got to try one
test after another till you hit the right one. And of course there
are certain poisons for which no recognised tests exist.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know all that,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tested things myself.
But these poisons with no recognised test&mdash;how do you set
about proving that they&rsquo;re there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, you&rsquo;d take the symptoms into account,
and so on. You would look at the history of the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but I want a poison that doesn&rsquo;t produce any symptoms.
Except death, of course&mdash;if you call that a symptom.
Isn&rsquo;t there a poison with no symptoms and no test? Something
that just makes you go off, Pouf! like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said the analyst, rather annoyed&mdash;for your
medical analyst lives by symptoms and tests, and nobody likes
suggestions that undermine the very foundations of his profession&mdash;&ldquo;not
even old age or mental decay. There are always
symptoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately, before symptoms of mental decay could become
too pronounced in Lord Peter, Parker sounded the call
to action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down to Leahampton with a warrant,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I may not use it, but the chief thinks it might be worth while
to make an inquiry. What with the Battersea mystery and the
Daniels business, and Bertha Gotobed, there seems to be a
feeling that there have been too many unexplained tragedies
this year, and the Press have begun yelping again, blast them!
There&rsquo;s an article in <i>John Citizen</i> this week, with a poster:
&lsquo;Ninety-six Murderers at Large,&rsquo; and the <i>Evening Views</i> is starting
its reports with &lsquo;Six weeks have now passed, and the police
are no nearer the solution&mdash;&rsquo; you know the kind of thing. We&rsquo;ll
simply have to get some sort of move on. Do you want to
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;a breath of country air would do me good,
I fancy. Blow away the cobwebs, don&rsquo;t you know. It might
even inspire me to invent a good way of murderin&rsquo; people. &lsquo;O
Inspiration, solitary child, warbling thy native wood-notes
wild&mdash;&rsquo; Did somebody write that, or did I invent it? It sounds
reminiscent, somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>Parker, who was out of temper, replied rather shortly, and
intimated that the police car would be starting for Leahampton
in an hour&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be there,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;though, mind you, I hate
being driven by another fellow. It feels so unsafe. Never mind.
I will be bloody, bold and resolute, as Queen Victoria said to
the Archbishop of Canterbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">They reached Leahampton without any incident to justify
Lord Peter&rsquo;s fears. Parker had brought another officer with him,
and on the way they picked up the Chief Constable of the
County, who appeared very dubiously disposed towards their
errand. Lord Peter, observing their array of five strong men,
going out to seize upon one young woman, was reminded of
the Marquise de Brinvilliers&mdash;(&ldquo;What! all that water for a little
person like me?&rdquo;)&mdash;but this led him back to the subject of
poison, and he remained steeped in thought and gloom till the
car drew up before the house in Wellington Avenue.</p>
<p>Parker got out, and went up the path with the Chief Constable.
The door was opened to them by a frightened-looking
maid, who gave a little shriek at sight of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir! have you come to say something&rsquo;s happened to
Miss Whittaker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Miss Whittaker at home, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. She went out in the car with Miss Vera Findlater
on Monday&mdash;that&rsquo;s four days back, sir, and she hasn&rsquo;t come
home, nor Miss Findlater neither, and I&rsquo;m frightened something&rsquo;s
happened to them. When I see you, sir, I thought you
was the police come to say there had been an accident. I didn&rsquo;t
know what to do, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skipped, by God!&rdquo; was Parker&rsquo;s instant thought, but he
controlled his annoyance, and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where they were going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crow&rsquo;s Beach, Miss Whittaker said, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good fifty miles,&rdquo; said the Chief Constable.
&ldquo;Probably they&rsquo;ve just decided to stay there a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely gone in the opposite direction,&rdquo; thought Parker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t take no things for the night, sir. They went
off about ten in the morning. They said they was going to have
lunch there and come home in the evening. And Miss Whittaker
hasn&rsquo;t written nor nothing. And her always so particular.
Cook and me, we didn&rsquo;t know what&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I expect it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the Chief Constable.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity, as we particularly wanted to see Miss Whittaker.
When you hear from her, you might say Sir Charles Pillington
called with a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. But please, sir, what ought we to do, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll have inquiries made. I&rsquo;m the
Chief Constable, you know, and I can soon find out whether
there&rsquo;s been an accident or anything. But if there had been,
depend upon it we should have heard about it. Come, my girl,
pull yourself together, there&rsquo;s nothing to cry about. We&rsquo;ll let
you know as soon as we hear anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sir Charles looked disturbed. Coming on top of Parker&rsquo;s
arrival in the district, the thing had an unpleasant look
about it.</p>
<p>Lord Peter received the news cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;joggle &rsquo;em up. Keep &rsquo;em moving. That&rsquo;s
the spirit. Always like it when somethin&rsquo; happens. My worst
suspicions are goin&rsquo; to be justified. That always makes one feel
so important and virtuous, don&rsquo;t you think? Wonder why she
took the girl with her, though. By the way, we&rsquo;d better look up
the Findlaters. They may have heard something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This obvious suggestion was acted upon at once. But at
the Findlaters&rsquo; house they drew blank. The family were at the
seaside, with the exception of Miss Vera, who was staying in
Wellington Avenue with Miss Whittaker. No anxiety was expressed
by the parlour-maid and none, apparently, felt. The
investigators took care not to arouse any alarm, and, leaving a
trivial and polite message from Sir Charles, withdrew for a
consultation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing for it, so far as I can see,&rdquo; said Parker,
&ldquo;but an all-stations call to look out for the car and the ladies.
And we must put inquiries through to all the ports, of course.
With four days&rsquo; start, they may be anywhere by now. I wish
to Heaven I&rsquo;d risked a bit and started earlier, approval or no
approval. What&rsquo;s this Findlater girl like? I&rsquo;d better go back to
the house and get photographs of her and the Whittaker woman.
And, Wimsey, I wish you&rsquo;d look in on Miss Climpson and see
if she has any information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you might tell &rsquo;em at the Yard to keep an eye on
Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;When anything sensational
happens to a criminal it&rsquo;s a good tip to watch the accomplice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sure you are both quite mistaken about this,&rdquo; urged
Sir Charles Pillington. &ldquo;Criminal&mdash;accomplice&mdash;bless me! I
have had considerable experience in the course of a long life&mdash;longer
than either of yours&mdash;and I really feel convinced that
Miss Whittaker, whom I know quite well, is as good and nice
a girl as you could wish to find. But there has undoubtedly
been an accident of some kind, and it is our duty to make the
fullest investigation. I will get on to Crow&rsquo;s Beach police immediately,
as soon as I know the description of the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an Austin Seven and the number is XX9917,&rdquo; said
Wimsey, much to the Chief Constable&rsquo;s surprise. &ldquo;But I doubt
very much whether you&rsquo;ll find it at Crow&rsquo;s Beach, or anywhere
near it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d better get a move on,&rdquo; snapped Parker. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d
better separate. How about a spot of lunch in an hour&rsquo;s time
at the George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wimsey was unlucky. Miss Climpson was not to be found.
She had had her lunch early and gone out, saying she felt that
a long country walk would do her good. Mrs. Budge was rather
afraid she had had some bad news&mdash;she had seemed so upset
and worried since yesterday evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;But indeed, sir,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;if you was quick, you might
find her up at the church. She often drops in there to say her
prayers like. Not a respectful way to approach a place of worship
to my mind, do you think so yourself, sir? Popping in and out
on a week-day, the same as if it was a friend&rsquo;s house. And
coming home from Communion as cheerful as anything and
ready to laugh and make jokes. I don&rsquo;t see as how we was meant
to make an ordinary thing of religion that way&mdash;so disrespectful
and nothing uplifting to the &rsquo;art about it. But there! we all &rsquo;as
our failings, and Miss Climpson is a nice lady and that I must
say, even if she is a Roaming Catholic or next door to one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter thought that Roaming Catholic was rather an
appropriate name for the more ultramontane section of the
High Church party. At the moment, however, he felt he could
not afford time for religious discussion, and set off for the
church in quest of Miss Climpson.</p>
<p>The doors of S. Onesimus were hospitably open, and the
red Sanctuary lamp made a little spot of welcoming brightness
in the rather dark building. Coming in from the June sunshine,
Wimsey blinked a little before he could distinguish anything
else. Presently he was able to make out a dark, bowed figure
kneeling before the lamp. For a moment he hoped it was Miss
Climpson, but presently saw to his disappointment that it was
merely a Sister in a black habit, presumably taking her turn to
watch before the Host. The only other occupant of the church
was a priest in a cassock, who was busy with the ornaments
on the High Altar. It was the Feast of S. John, Wimsey remembered
suddenly. He walked up the aisle, hoping to find
his quarry hidden in some obscure corner. His shoes squeaked.
This annoyed him. It was a thing which Bunter never permitted.
He was seized with a fancy that the squeak was produced
by diabolic possession&mdash;a protest against a religious atmosphere
on the part of his own particular besetting devil. Pleased with
this thought, he moved forward more confidently.</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s attention was attracted by the squeak. He turned
and came down towards the intruder. No doubt, thought Wimsey,
to offer his professional services to exorcise the evil spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you looking for anybody?&rdquo; inquired the priest, courteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was looking for a lady,&rdquo; began Wimsey. Then it
struck him that this sounded a little odd under the circumstances,
and he hastened to explain more fully, in the stifled
tones considered appropriate to consecrated surroundings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the priest, quite unperturbed, &ldquo;Miss
Climpson was here a little time ago, but I fancy she has gone.
Not that I usually keep tabs on my flock,&rdquo; he added, with a
laugh, &ldquo;but she spoke to me before she went. Was it urgent?
What a pity you should have missed her. Can I give any kind
of message or help you in any way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;Sorry to bother you. Unseemly
to come and try to haul people out of church, but&mdash;yes,
it was rather important. I&rsquo;ll leave a message at the house.
Thanks frightfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away; then stopped and came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you give advice on moral problems and
all that sort of thing, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re supposed to try,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;Is anything
bothering you in particular?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;nothing religious, I don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;nothing
about infallibility or the Virgin Mary or anything of
that sort. Just something I&rsquo;m not comfortable about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest&mdash;who was, in fact, the vicar, Mr. Tredgold&mdash;indicated
that he was quite at Lord Peter&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you. Could we come somewhere where
I didn&rsquo;t have to whisper so much. I never can explain things
in a whisper. Sort of paralyses one, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go outside,&rdquo; said Mr. Tredgold.</p>
<p>So they went out and sat on a flat tombstone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;Hypothetical case, you see,
and so on. S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; one knows somebody who&rsquo;s very, very ill
and can&rsquo;t last long anyhow. And they&rsquo;re in awful pain and all
that, and kept under morphia&mdash;practically dead to the world,
you know. And suppose that by dyin&rsquo; straight away they could
make something happen which they really wanted to happen
and which couldn&rsquo;t happen if they lived on a little longer (I
can&rsquo;t explain exactly how, because I don&rsquo;t want to give personal
details and so on)&mdash;you get the idea? Well, supposin&rsquo; somebody
who knew all that was just to give &rsquo;em a little push off so to
speak&mdash;hurry matters on&mdash;why should that be a very dreadful
crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law&mdash;&rdquo; began Mr. Tredgold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the law says it&rsquo;s a crime, fast enough,&rdquo; said Wimsey.
&ldquo;But do you honestly think it&rsquo;s very bad? I know you&rsquo;d call it
a sin, of course, but why is it so very dreadful? It doesn&rsquo;t do
the person any harm, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t answer that,&rdquo; said Mr. Tredgold, &ldquo;without knowing
the ways of God with the soul. In those last weeks or hours
of pain and unconsciousness, the soul may be undergoing some
necessary part of its pilgrimage on earth. It isn&rsquo;t our business
to cut it short. Who are we to take life and death into our
hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we do it all day, one way and another. Juries&mdash;soldiers&mdash;doctors&mdash;all
that. And yet I do feel, somehow, that
it isn&rsquo;t a right thing in this case. And yet, by interfering&mdash;finding
things out and so on&mdash;one may do far worse harm.
Start all kinds of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Mr. Tredgold, &ldquo;that the sin&mdash;I won&rsquo;t use
that word&mdash;the damage to Society, the wrongness of the thing
lies much more in the harm it does the killer than in anything
it can do to the person who is killed. Especially, of course, if
the killing is to the killer&rsquo;s own advantage. The consequence
you mention&mdash;this thing which the sick person wants done&mdash;does
the other person stand to benefit by it, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s just it. He&mdash;she&mdash;they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That puts it at once on a different plane from just hastening
a person&rsquo;s death out of pity. Sin is in the intention, not
the deed. That is the difference between divine law and human
law. It is bad for a human being to get to feel that he has any
right whatever to dispose of another person&rsquo;s life to his own
advantage. It leads him to think himself above all laws&mdash;Society
is never safe from the man who has deliberately committed
murder with impunity. That is why&mdash;or one reason why&mdash;God
forbids private vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that one murder leads to another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very often. In any case it leads to a readiness to commit
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has. That&rsquo;s the trouble. But it wouldn&rsquo;t have if I hadn&rsquo;t
started trying to find things out. Ought I to have left it alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. That is very difficult. Terrible, too, for you. You
feel responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;You yourself are not serving a private vengeance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Nothing really to do with me. Started in like a
fool to help somebody who&rsquo;d got into trouble about the thing
through having suspicions himself. And my beastly interference
started the crimes all over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be too troubled. Probably the murderer&rsquo;s own
guilty fears would have led him into fresh crimes even without
your interference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Wimsey, remembering Mr. Trigg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My advice to you is to do what you think is right, according
to the laws which we have been brought up to respect.
Leave the consequences to God. And try to think charitably,
even of wicked people. You know what I mean. Bring the
offender to justice, but remember that if we all got justice, you
and I wouldn&rsquo;t escape either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Knock the man down but don&rsquo;t dance on the
body. Quite. Forgive my troublin&rsquo; you&mdash;and excuse my bargin&rsquo;
off, because I&rsquo;ve got a date with a friend. Thanks so much. I
don&rsquo;t feel quite so rotten about it now. But I was gettin&rsquo; worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tredgold watched him as he trotted away between the
graves. &ldquo;Dear, dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how nice they are. So kindly
and scrupulous and so vague outside their public-school code.
And much more nervous and sensitive than people think. A
very difficult class to reach. I must make a special intention
for him at Mass to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being a practical man, Mr. Tredgold made a knot in his
handkerchief to remind himself of this pious resolve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The problem&mdash;to interfere or not to interfere&mdash;God&rsquo;s law
and C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s. Policemen, now&mdash;it&rsquo;s no problem to them. But
for the ordinary man&mdash;how hard to disentangle his own motives.
I wonder what brought him here. Could it possibly be&mdash;No!&rdquo;
said the vicar, checking himself, &ldquo;I have no right to speculate.&rdquo;
He drew out his handkerchief again and made another
mnemonic knot as a reminder against his next confession that
he had fallen into the sin of inquisitiveness.</p>

<p class="tb">Parker, too, had spent a disappointing half-hour. It appeared that
Miss Whittaker not only disliked having her photograph taken,
but had actually destroyed all the existing portraits she could lay
hands on, shortly after Miss Dawson&rsquo;s death. Of course, many
of Miss Whittaker&rsquo;s friends might be in possession of one&mdash;notably,
of course, Miss Findlater. But Parker was not sure that he
wanted to start a local hue-and-cry at the moment. Miss Climpson
might be able to get one, of course. He went round to Nelson
Avenue. Miss Climpson was out; there had been another gentleman
asking for her. Mrs. Budge&rsquo;s eyes were beginning to bulge
with curiosity&mdash;evidently she was becoming dubious about Miss
Climpson&rsquo;s &ldquo;nephew&rdquo; and his friends. Parker then went to the
local photographers. There were five. From two of them he extracted
a number of local groups, containing unrecognisable portraits
of Miss Whittaker at church bazaars and private theatricals.
She had never had a studio portrait made in Leahampton.</p>
<p>Of Miss Findlater, on the other hand, he got several excellent
likenesses&mdash;a slight, fair girl, with a rather sentimental
look&mdash;plump and prettyish. All these he despatched to Town,
with directions that they should be broadcast to the police,
together with a description of the girl&rsquo;s dress when last seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>The only really cheerful members of the party at the
&ldquo;George&rdquo; were the second policeman, who had been having a
pleasant gossip with various garage-proprietors and publicans,
with a view to picking up information, and the Chief Constable,
who was vindicated and triumphant. He had been telephoning
to various country police-stations, and had discovered
that XX9917 had actually been observed on the previous Monday
by an A.A. scout on the road to Crow&rsquo;s Beach. Having
maintained all along that the Crow&rsquo;s Beach excursion was a
genuine one, he was inclined to exult over the Scotland Yard
man. Wimsey and Parker dispiritedly agreed that they had
better go down and make inquiries at Crow&rsquo;s Beach.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one of the photographers, whose cousin was on
the staff of the <i>Leahampton Mercury</i>, had put a call through to
the office of that up-to-date paper, which was just going to press.
A stop-press announcement was followed by a special edition;
somebody rang up the London <i>Evening Views</i> which burst out
into a front-page scoop; the fat was in the fire, and the <i>Daily Yell</i>,
<i>Daily Views</i>, <i>Daily Wire</i> and <i>Daily Tidings</i>, who were all suffering
from lack of excitement, came brightly out next morning
with bold headlines about disappearing young women.</p>
<p>Crow&rsquo;s Beach, indeed, that pleasant and respectable watering-place,
knew nothing of Miss Whittaker, Miss Findlater, or
car XX9917. No hotel had received them; no garage had refuelled
or repaired them; no policeman had observed them. The
Chief Constable held to his theory of an accident, and scouting
parties were sent out. Wires arrived at Scotland Yard from all over
the place. They had been seen at Dover, at Newcastle, at Sheffield,
at Winchester, at Rugby. Two young women had had tea
in a suspicious manner at Folkestone; a car had passed noisily
through Dorchester at a late hour on Monday night; a dark-haired
girl in an &ldquo;agitated condition&rdquo; had entered a public-house in New
Alresford just before closing-time and asked the way to Hazelmere.
Among all these reports, Parker selected that of a boy-scout,
who reported on the Saturday morning that he had noticed two
ladies with a car having a picnic on the downs on the previous
Monday, not far from Shelly Head. The car was an Austin
Seven&mdash;he knew that, because he was keen on motors (an unanswerable
reason for accuracy in a boy of his age), and he had
noticed that it was a London number, though he couldn&rsquo;t say
positively what the number was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Shelly Head lies about ten miles along the coast from
Crow&rsquo;s Beach, and is curiously lonely, considering how near
it lies to the watering-place. Under the cliffs is a long stretch
of clear sandy beach, never visited, and overlooked by no houses.
The cliffs themselves are chalk, and covered with short turf,
running back into a wide expanse of downs, covered with gorse
and heather. Then comes a belt of pine-trees, beyond which
is a steep, narrow and rutty road, leading at length into the
tarmac high-road between Ramborough and Ryders Heath.
The downs are by no means frequented, though there are plenty
of rough tracks which a car can follow, if you are not particular
about comfort or fussy over your springs.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of the boy-scout, the police-car bumped
uncomfortably over these disagreeable roads. It was hopeless to
look for any previous car-tracks, for the chalk was dry and hard,
and the grass and heath retained no marks. Everywhere, little
dells and hollows presented themselves&mdash;all exactly alike, and
many of them capable of hiding a small car, not to speak of the
mere signs and remains of a recent picnic. Having arrived at what
their guide thought to be approximately the right place, they pulled
up and got out. Parker quartered the ground between the five of
them and they set off.</p>
<p>Wimsey took a dislike to gorse-bushes that day. There were
so many of them and so thick. Any of them might hold a
cigarette package or a sandwich paper or a scrap of cloth or a
clue of some kind. He trudged along unhappily, back bent and
eyes on the ground, over one ridge and down into the hollow&mdash;then
circling to right and to left, taking his bearings by the
police-car; over the next ridge and down into the next hollow;
over the next ridge&mdash;</p>
<p>Yes. There was something in the hollow.</p>
<p>He saw it first sticking out round the edge of a gorse-bush.
It was light in colour, and pointed, rather like a foot.</p>
<p>He felt a little sick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody has gone to sleep here,&rdquo; he said aloud.</p>
<p>Then he thought:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;Funny&mdash;it&rsquo;s always the feet they leave showing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scrambled down among the bushes, slipping on the
short turf and nearly rolling to the bottom. He swore irritably.</p>
<p>The person was sleeping oddly. The flies must be a nuisance
all over her head like that.</p>
<p>It occurred to him that it was rather early in the year for
flies. There had been an advertising rhyme in the papers.
Something about &ldquo;Each fly you swat now means, remember,
Three hundred fewer next September.&rdquo; Or was it a thousand
fewer? He couldn&rsquo;t get the metre quite right.</p>
<p>Then he pulled himself together and went forward. The
flies rose up in a little cloud.</p>
<p>It must have been a pretty heavy blow, he thought, to
smash the back of the skull in like that. The shingled hair was
blonde. The face lay between the bare arms.</p>
<p>He turned the body on its back.</p>
<p>Of course, without the photograph, he could not&mdash;he
need not&mdash;be certain that this was Vera Findlater.</p>
<p>All this had taken him perhaps thirty seconds.</p>
<p>He scrambled up to the rim of the hollow and shouted.</p>
<p>A small black figure at some distance stopped and turned.
He saw its face as a white spot with no expression on it. He shouted
again, and waved his arms in wide gestures of explanation. The
figure came running; it lurched slowly and awkwardly over the
heathy ground. It was the policeman&mdash;a heavy man, not built
for running in the heat. Wimsey shouted again, and the policeman
shouted too. Wimsey saw the others closing in upon him.
The grotesque figure of the boy-scout topped a ridge, waving its
staff&mdash;then disappeared again. The policeman was quite near
now. His bowler hat was thrust back on his head, and there was
something on his watch-chain that glinted in the sun as he ran.
Wimsey found himself running to meet him and calling&mdash;explaining
at great length. It was too far off to make himself heard,
but he explained, wordily, with emphasis, pointing, indicating.
He was quite breathless when the policeman and he came together.
They were both breathless. They wagged their heads and
gasped. It was ludicrous. He started running again, with the man
at his heels. Presently they were all there, pointing, measuring,
taking notes, grubbing under the gorse-bushes. Wimsey sat down.
He was dreadfully tired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; said Parker&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;come and look at this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got up wearily.</p>
<p>There were the remains of a picnic lunch a little farther
down the hollow. The policeman had a little bag in his hand&mdash;he
had taken it from under the body, and was now turning
over the trifles it contained. On the ground, close to the dead
girl&rsquo;s head, was a thick, heavy spanner&mdash;unpleasantly discoloured
and with a few fair hairs sticking to its jaws. But what
Parker was calling his attention to was none of these, but a
man&rsquo;s mauve-grey cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find that?&rdquo; asked Wimsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alf here picked it up at the top of the hollow,&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tumbled off into the gorse it was,&rdquo; corroborated the scout,
&ldquo;just up here, lying upside down just as if it had fallen off
somebody&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any footmarks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely. But there&rsquo;s a place where the bushes are all trodden
and broken. Looks as if there&rsquo;d been some sort of struggle.
What&rsquo;s become of the Austin? Hi! don&rsquo;t touch that spanner, my
lad. There may be finger-prints on it. This looks like an attack
by some gang or other. Any money in that purse? Ten-shilling
note, sixpence and a few coppers&mdash;oh! Well, the other woman
may have had more on her. She&rsquo;s very well off, you know. Held
up for ransom, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&rdquo; Parker bent down and very
gingerly enfolded the spanner in a silk handkerchief, carrying it
slung by the four corners. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d better spread about and
have a look for the car. Better try that belt of trees over there.
Looks a likely spot. And, Hopkins&mdash;I think you&rsquo;d better run back
with our car to Crow&rsquo;s Beach and let &rsquo;em know at the station, and
come back with a photographer. And take this wire and send it
to the Chief Commissioner at Scotland Yard, and find a doctor
and bring him along with you. And you&rsquo;d better hire another car
while you&rsquo;re about it, in case we don&rsquo;t find the Austin&mdash;we shall
be too many to get away in this one. Take Alf back with you if
you&rsquo;re not sure of finding the place again. Oh! and Hopkins, fetch
us along something to eat and drink, will you, we may be at it a
long time. Here&rsquo;s some money&mdash;that enough?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The constable went off, taking Alf, who was torn between
a desire to stay and do some more detecting, and the pride and
glory of being first back with the news. Parker gave a few words
of praise for his valuable assistance which filled him with delight,
and then turned to the Chief Constable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They obviously went off in this direction. Would you
bear away to the left, sir, and enter the trees from that end,
and Peter, will you bear to the right and work through from
the other end, while I go straight up the middle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief Constable, who seemed a good deal shaken by
the discovery of the body, obeyed without a word. Wimsey
caught Parker by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have you looked at the wound? Something
funny, isn&rsquo;t there? There ought to be more mess, somehow.
What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking anything for the moment,&rdquo; said Parker,
a little grimly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait for the doctor&rsquo;s report. Come on,
Steve! We want to dig out that car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at the cap. H&rsquo;m. Sold by a gentleman,
resident in Stepney. Almost new. Smells strongly of California
Poppy&mdash;rather a swell sort of gangsman, apparently. Quite one
of the lads of the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;we ought to be able to trace that. Thank Heaven,
they always overlook something. Well, we&rsquo;d better get along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The search for the car presented no difficulties. Parker stumbled
upon it almost as soon as he got in under the trees. There
was a clearing, with a little rivulet of water running through it,
beside which stood the missing Austin. There were other trees
here, mingled with the pines, and the water made an elbow and
spread into a shallow pool, with a kind of muddy beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>The hood of the car was up, and Parker approached with an
uncomfortable feeling that there might be something disagreeable
inside, but it was empty. He tried the gears. They were in
neutral and the handbrake was on. On the seat was a handkerchief&mdash;a
large linen handkerchief, very grubby and with no initials
or laundry-mark. Parker grunted a little over the criminal&rsquo;s
careless habit of strewing his belongings about. He came round
in front of the car and received immediate further proof of carelessness.
For on the mud there were footmarks&mdash;two men&rsquo;s and
a woman&rsquo;s, it seemed.</p>
<p>The woman had got out of the car first&mdash;he could see where
the left heel had sunk heavily in as she extricated herself from the
low seat. Then the right foot&mdash;less heavily&mdash;then she had staggered
a little and started to run. But one of the men had been
there to catch her. He had stepped out of the bracken in shoes
with new rubbers on them, and there were some scuffling marks
as though he had held her and she had tried to break away. Finally,
the second man, who seemed to possess rather narrow feet
and to wear the long-toed boots affected by town boys of the louder
sort&mdash;had come after her from the car&mdash;the marks of his feet
were clear, crossing and half-obliterating hers. All three had stood
together for a little. Then the tracks moved away, with those of
the woman in the middle, and led up to where the mark of a
Michelin balloon tyre showed clearly. The tyres of the Austin
were ordinary Dunlops&mdash;besides, this was obviously a bigger car.
It had apparently stood there for some little time, for a little pool
of engine-oil had dripped from the crank-case. Then the bigger
car had moved off, down a sort of ride that led away through the
trees. Parker followed it for a little distance, but the tracks soon
became lost in a thick carpet of pine-needles. Still, there was no
other road for a car to take. He turned to the Austin to investigate
further. Presently shouts told him that the other two were converging
upon the centre of the wood. He called back and before
long Wimsey and Sir Charles Pillington came crashing towards
him through the bracken which fringed the pines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;I imagine we may put down this
elegant bit of purple headgear to the gentleman in the slim
boots. Bright yellow, I fancy, with buttons. He must be lamenting
his beautiful cap. The woman&rsquo;s footprints belong to
Mary Whittaker, I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. I don&rsquo;t see how they can be the Findlater
girl&rsquo;s. This woman went or was taken off in the car.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are certainly not Vera Findlater&rsquo;s&mdash;there was no
mud on her shoes when we found her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you were taking notice, then. I thought you were
feeling a bit dead to the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I was, old dear, but I can&rsquo;t help noticin&rsquo; things, though
moribund. Hullo! what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his hand down behind the cushions of the car and
pulled out an American magazine&mdash;that monthly collection
of mystery and sensational fiction published under the name
of <i>The Black Mask</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light reading for the masses,&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brought by the gentleman in the yellow boots, perhaps,&rdquo;
suggested the Chief Constable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely by Miss Findlater,&rdquo; said Wimsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly a lady&rsquo;s choice,&rdquo; said Sir Charles, in a pained
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dunno. From all I hear, Miss Whittaker was dead
against sentimentality and roses round the porch, and the other
poor girl copied her in everything. They might have a boyish
taste in fiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not important,&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit. Look at this. Somebody&rsquo;s been making marks
on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wimsey held out the cover for inspection. A thick pencil-mark
had been drawn under the first two words of the title.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s some sort of message? Perhaps the book
was on the seat, and she contrived to make the marks unnoticed
and shove it away here before they transferred her to the other
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ingenious,&rdquo; said Sir Charles, &ldquo;but what does it mean?
The Black. It makes no sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the long-toed gentleman was a black man,&rdquo; suggested
Parker. &ldquo;Or possibly a Hindu or Parsee of sorts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul,&rdquo; said Sir Charles, horrified, &ldquo;an English
girl in the hands of a black man. How abominable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll hope it isn&rsquo;t so. Shall we follow the road out
or wait for the doctor to arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better go back to the body, I think,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
got a long start of us, and half an hour more or less in following
them up won&rsquo;t make much odds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned from the translucent cool greenness of the
little wood back on to the downs. The streamlet clacked merrily
away over the pebbles, running out to the southwest on its way
to the river and the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well your chattering,&rdquo; said Wimsey to the
water. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you say what you&rsquo;ve seen?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br><span class="h2line2">By What Means?</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Death hath so many doors to let out life.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">Beaumont and Fletcher, <i>Custom of the Country</i></p>
</div>
<p class="tb">The doctor turned out to be a plumpish, fussy man&mdash;and what
Wimsey impatiently called a &ldquo;Tutster.&rdquo; He tutted over the mangled
head of poor Vera Findlater as though it was an attack of
measles after a party or a self-provoked fit of the gout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tst, tst, tst. A terrible blow. How did we come by that,
I wonder? Tst, tst. Life extinct? Oh, for several days, you know.
Tst, tst&mdash;which makes it so much more painful, of course.
Dear me, how shocking for her poor parents. And her sisters.
They are very agreeable girls; you know them, of course, Sir
Charles. Yes. Tst, tst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt, I suppose,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;that it is Miss
Findlater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; said Sir Charles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as you can identify her, it may be possible to spare
the relatives the shock of seeing her like this. Just a moment,
doctor&mdash;the photographer wants to record the position of the
body before you move anything. Now, Mr.&mdash;Andrews?&mdash;yes&mdash;have
you ever done any photographs of this kind before? No?&mdash;well,
you mustn&rsquo;t be upset by it! I know it&rsquo;s rather unpleasant.
One from here, please, to show the position of the body&mdash;now
from the top of the bank&mdash;that&rsquo;s right&mdash;now one of the
wound itself&mdash;a close-up view, please. Yes. Thank you. Now,
doctor, you can turn her over, please&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mr. Andrews&mdash;I
know exactly how you are feeling, but these things
have to be done. Hullo! look how her arms are all scratched
about. Looks as if she&rsquo;d put up a bit of a fight. The right wrist
and left elbow&mdash;as though someone had been trying to hold
her down. We must have a photograph of the marks, Mr.
Andrews&mdash;they may be important. I say, doctor, what do you
make of this on the face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor looked as though he would have preferred not
to make so much as an examination of the face. However, with
many tuts he worked himself up to giving an opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as one can tell, with all these post-mortem changes,&rdquo;
he ventured, &ldquo;it looks as though the face had been roughened
or burnt about the nose and lips. Yet there is no appearance
of the kind on the bridge of the nose, neck or forehead. Tst,
tst&mdash;otherwise I should have put it down to severe sunburn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about chloroform burns?&rdquo; suggested Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tst, tst,&rdquo; said the doctor, annoyed at not having thought
of this himself&mdash;&ldquo;I wish you gentlemen of the police force
would not be quite so abrupt. You want everything decided in
too great a hurry. I was about to remark&mdash;if you had not
anticipated me&mdash;that since I could <i>not</i> put the appearance
down to sunburn, there remains some such possibility as you
suggest. I can&rsquo;t possibly say that it is the result of chloroform&mdash;medical
pronouncements of that kind cannot be hastily made
without cautious investigation&mdash;but I was about to remark that
it <i>might</i> be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; put in Wimsey, &ldquo;could she have died from
the effects of the chloroform? Supposing she was given too
much or that her heart was weak?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;My good sir,&rdquo; said the doctor, deeply offended this time,
&ldquo;look at that blow upon the head, and ask yourself whether it
is necessary to suggest any other cause of death. Moreover, if
she had died of the chloroform, where would be the necessity
for the blow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is exactly what I was wondering,&rdquo; said Wimsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; went on the doctor, &ldquo;you will hardly dispute
my medical knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;but as you say, it is unwise
to make any medical pronouncement without cautious investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is not the place for it,&rdquo; put in Parker, hastily. &ldquo;I
think we have done all there is to do here. Will you go with
the body to the mortuary, doctor. Mr. Andrews, I shall be
obliged if you will come and take a few photographs of some
footmarks and so on up in the wood. The light is bad, I&rsquo;m
afraid, but we must do our best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took Wimsey by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man is a fool, of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but we can get
a second opinion. In the meantime, we had better let it be
supposed that we accept the surface explanation of all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the difficulty?&rdquo; asked Sir Charles, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing much,&rdquo; replied Parker. &ldquo;All the appearances
are in favour of the girls having been attacked by a couple of
ruffians, who have carried Miss Whittaker off with a view to
ransom, after brutally knocking Miss Findlater on the head
when she offered resistance. Probably that is the true explanation.
Any minor discrepancies will doubtless clear themselves
up in time. We shall know better when we have had a
proper medical examination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They returned to the wood, where photographs were taken
and careful measurements made of the footprints. The Chief
Constable followed these activities with intense interest, looking
over Parker&rsquo;s shoulder as he entered the particulars in his
notebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said, suddenly, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it rather odd&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s somebody coming,&rdquo; broke in Parker.</p>
<p>The sound of a motor-cycle being urged in second gear
over the rough ground proved to be the herald of a young man
armed with a camera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; groaned Parker. &ldquo;The damned Press already.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>He received the journalist courteously enough, showing
him the wheel-tracks and the footprints, and outlining the
kidnapping theory as they walked back to the place where the
body was found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you give us any idea, Inspector, of the appearance
of the two wanted men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;one of them appears to be something
of a dandy; he wears a loathsome mauve cap and narrow pointed
shoes, and, if those marks on the magazine cover mean anything,
one or other of the men may possibly be a coloured
man of some kind. Of the second man, all we can definitely
say is that he wears number 10 shoes, with rubber heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to say,&rdquo; said Pillington, &ldquo;that, &agrave; propos de
bottes, it is rather remarkable&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is where we found the body of Miss Findlater,&rdquo;
went on Parker, ruthlessly. He described the injuries and the
position of the body, and the journalist gratefully occupied
himself with taking photographs, including a group of Wimsey,
Parker and the Chief Constable standing among the gorse-bushes,
while the latter majestically indicated the fatal spot
with his walking-stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you&rsquo;ve got what you want, old son,&rdquo; said Parker,
benevolently, &ldquo;buzz off, won&rsquo;t you, and tell the rest of the boys.
You&rsquo;ve got all we can tell you, and we&rsquo;ve got other things to
do beyond granting special interviews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter asked no better. This was tantamount to
making his information exclusive, and no Victorian matron
could have a more delicate appreciation of the virtues of exclusiveness
than a modern newspaper man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said Parker, when the man had
happily chugged and popped himself away, &ldquo;what were you
about to say in the matter of the footprints?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sir Charles was offended. The Scotland Yard man
had snubbed him and thrown doubt on his discretion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I feel sure that my conclusions
would appear very elementary to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he preserved a dignified silence throughout the return
journey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p class="tb">The Whittaker case had begun almost imperceptibly, in
the overhearing of a casual remark dropped in a Soho restaurant;
it ended amid a roar of publicity that shook England from
end to end and crowded even Wimbledon into the second
place. The bare facts of the murder and kidnapping appeared
exclusively that night in a Late Extra edition of the <i>Evening
Views</i>. Next morning it sprawled over the Sunday papers with
photographs and full details, actual and imaginary. The idea
of two English girls&mdash;the one brutally killed, the other carried
off for some end unthinkably sinister, by a black man&mdash;aroused
all the passion of horror and indignation of which the English
temperament is capable. Reporters swarmed down upon Crow&rsquo;s
Beach like locusts&mdash;the downs near Shelly Head were like a
fair with motors, bicycles and parties on foot, rushing out to
spend a happy week-end amid surroundings of mystery and
bloodshed. Parker, who with Wimsey had taken rooms at the
Green Lion, sat answering the telephone and receiving the
letters and wires which descended upon him from all sides,
with a stalwart policeman posted at the end of the passage to
keep out all intruders.</p>
<p>Wimsey fidgeted about the room, smoking cigarette after
cigarette in his excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time we&rsquo;ve got them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve overreached
themselves, thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But have a little patience, old man. We can&rsquo;t lose
them&mdash;but we must have all the facts first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure those fellows have got Mrs. Forrest safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. She came back to the flat on Monday night&mdash;or
so the garage man says. Our men are shadowing her continually
and will let us know the moment anybody comes to
the flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monday night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But that&rsquo;s no proof in itself. Monday night is quite
a usual time for week-enders to return to Town. Besides, I don&rsquo;t
want to frighten her till we know whether she&rsquo;s the principal
or merely the accomplice. Look here, Peter, I&rsquo;ve had a message
from another of our men. He&rsquo;s been looking into the finances
of Miss Whittaker and Mrs. Forrest. Miss Whittaker has been
drawing out big sums, ever since last December year in cheques
to Self, and these correspond almost exactly, amount for amount,
with sums which Mrs. Forrest has been paying into her own
account. That woman has had a big hold over Miss Whittaker,
ever since old Miss Dawson died. She&rsquo;s in it up to the neck,
Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it. She&rsquo;s been doing the jobs while the Whittaker
woman held down her alibi in Kent. For God&rsquo;s sake, Charles,
make no mistake. Nobody&rsquo;s life is safe for a second while either
of them is at large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a woman is wicked and unscrupulous,&rdquo; said Parker,
sententiously, &ldquo;she is the most ruthless criminal in the world&mdash;fifty
times worse than a man, because she is always so much
more single-minded about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not troubled with sentimentality, that&rsquo;s why,&rdquo; said
Wimsey, &ldquo;and we poor mutts of men stuff ourselves up with
the idea that they&rsquo;re romantic and emotional. All punk, my
son. Damn that &rsquo;phone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker snatched up the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;speaking. Good God, you don&rsquo;t say so. All
right. Yes. Yes, of course you must detain him. I think myself
it&rsquo;s a plant, but he must be held and questioned. And see that
all the papers have it. Tell &rsquo;em you&rsquo;re sure he&rsquo;s the man. See?
Soak it well into &rsquo;em that that&rsquo;s the official view. And&mdash;wait
a moment&mdash;I want photographs of the cheque and of any
finger-prints on it. Send &rsquo;em down immediately by a special
messenger. It&rsquo;s genuine, I suppose? The Bank people say it is?
Good! What&rsquo;s his story?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. any envelope?&mdash;Destroyed?&mdash;Silly
devil. Right. Right. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Wimsey with some excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hallelujah Dawson walked into Lloyds Bank in Stepney
yesterday morning and presented Mary Whittaker&rsquo;s cheque for
&pound;10,000, drawn on their Leahampton branch to Bearer, and
dated Friday 24th. As the sum was such a large one and the
story of the disappearance was in Friday night&rsquo;s paper, they
asked him to call again. Meanwhile, they communicated with
Leahampton. When the news of the murder came out yesterday
evening, the Leahampton manager remembered about it and
&rsquo;phoned the Yard, with the result that they sent round this
morning and had Hallelujah up for a few inquiries. His story
is that the cheque arrived on Saturday morning, all by itself
in an envelope, without a word of explanation. Of course the
old juggins chucked the envelope away, so that we can&rsquo;t verify
his tale or get a line on the post-mark. Our people thought the
whole thing looked a bit fishy, so Hallelujah is detained pending
investigation&mdash;in other words, arrested for murder and conspiracy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Hallelujah! Charles, this is simply devilish! That
innocent, decent old creature, who couldn&rsquo;t harm a fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Well, he&rsquo;s in for it and will have to go through
with it. It&rsquo;s all the better for us. Hell&rsquo;s bells, there&rsquo;s somebody
at the door. Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dr. Faulkner to see you, sir,&rdquo; said the constable,
putting his head in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good. Come in, doctor. Have you made your examination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, Inspector. Very interesting. You were quite right.
I&rsquo;ll tell you that much straight away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that. Sit down and tell us all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be as brief as possible,&rdquo; said the doctor. He was a
London man, sent down by Scotland Yard, and accustomed
to police work&mdash;a lean, grey badger of a man, business-like
and keen-eyed, the direct opposite of the &ldquo;tutster&rdquo; who had
annoyed Parker the evening before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, first of all, the blow on the head had, of course,
nothing whatever to do with the death. You saw yourself that
there had been next to no bleeding. The wound was inflicted
some time after death&mdash;no doubt to create the impression of
an attack by a gang. Similarly with the cuts and scratches on
the arms. They are the merest camouflage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Your colleague&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My colleague, as you call him, is a fool,&rdquo; snorted the
doctor. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s a specimen of his diagnosis, I should think
there would be a high death-rate in Crow&rsquo;s Beach. That&rsquo;s by
the way. You want the cause of death?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chloroform?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. I opened the body but found no special symptoms
suggestive of poisoning or anything. I have removed the
necessary organs and sent them to Sir James Lubbock for analysis
at your suggestion, but candidly I expect nothing from that.
There was no odour of chloroform on opening the thorax.
Either the time elapsed since the death was too long, as is very
possible, seeing how volatile the stuff is, or the dose was too
small. I found no indications of any heart weakness, so that,
to produce death in a healthy young girl, chloroform would
have had to be administered over a considerable time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it was administered at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it was. The burns on the face certainly suggest
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would also account for the handkerchief found in
the car,&rdquo; said Wimsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; pursued Parker, &ldquo;that it would require considerable
strength and determination to administer chloroform
to a strong young woman. She would probably resist strenuously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would,&rdquo; said the doctor, grimly, &ldquo;But the odd thing
is, she didn&rsquo;t. As I said before, all the marks of violence were
inflicted post-mortem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose she had been asleep at the time,&rdquo; suggested
Wimsey, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t it have been done quietly then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;easily. After a few long breaths of the stuff she
would become semi-conscious and then could be more firmly
dealt with. It is quite possible, I suppose, that she fell asleep
in the sunshine, while her companion wandered off and was
kidnapped, and that the kidnappers then came along and got
rid of Miss Findlater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems a little unnecessary,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;Why come
back to her at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suggest that they both fell asleep and were both
set on and chloroformed at the same time? It sounds rather
unlikely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>He outlined the history of their suspicions about Mary
Whittaker, to which the doctor listened in horrified amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;as we think, is this. We
think that for some reason Miss Whittaker had determined to
get rid of this poor girl who was so devoted to her. She arranged
that they should go off for a picnic and that it should be known
where they were going to. Then, when Vera Findlater was
dozing in the sunshine, our theory is that she murdered her&mdash;either
with chloroform or&mdash;more likely, I fancy&mdash;by the same
method that she used upon her other victims, whatever that
was. Then she struck her on the head and produced the other
appearances suggestive of a struggle, and left on the bushes a
cap which she had previously purchased and stained with brilliantine.
I am, of course, having the cap traced. Miss Whittaker
is a tall, powerful woman&mdash;l don&rsquo;t think it would be beyond
her strength to inflict that blow on an unresisting body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about those footmarks in the wood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that. There are one or two very odd things
about them. To begin with, if this was the work of a secret
gang, why should they go out of their way to pick out the one
damp, muddy spot in twenty miles of country to leave their
footprints in, when almost anywhere else they could have come
and gone without leaving any recognisable traces at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good point,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;And I add to that, that
they must have noticed they&rsquo;d left a cap behind. Why not come
back and remove it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Then again. Both pairs of shoes left prints entirely
free from the marks left by wear and tear. I mean that
there were no signs of the heels or soles being worn at all,
While the rubbers on the larger pair were obviously just out of
the shop. We shall have the photographs here in a moment,
and you will see. Of course, it&rsquo;s not impossible that both men
should be wearing brand new shoes, but on the whole it&rsquo;s
unlikely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; agreed the doctor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now we come to the most suggestive thing of all.
One of the supposed men had very much bigger feet than the
other, from which you would expect a taller and possibly heavier
man with a longer stride. But on measuring the footprints,
what do we find? In all three cases&mdash;the big man, the little
man and the woman&mdash;we have exactly the same length of
stride. Not only that, but the footprints have sunk into the
ground to precisely the same depth, indicating that all three
people were of the same weight. Now, the other discrepancies
might pass, but that is absolutely beyond the reach of coincidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Faulkner considered this for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve proved your point,&rdquo; he said at length. &ldquo;I consider
that absolutely convincing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It struck even Sir Charles Pillington, who is none too
bright,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;I had the greatest difficulty in preventing
him from blurting out the extraordinary agreement of the measurements
to that <i>Evening Views</i> man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think, then, that Miss Whittaker had come provided
with these shoes and produced the tracks herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, returning each time through the bracken. Cleverly
done. She had made no mistake about superimposing the footprints.
It was all worked out to a nicety&mdash;each set over and
under the two others, to produce the impression that three
people had been there at the same time. Intensive study of the
works of Mr. Austin Freeman, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think we shall find that this Mrs. Forrest, who
we think has been her accomplice all along, had brought her
car down&mdash;the big car, that is&mdash;and was waiting there for her.
Possibly she did the making of the footprints while Mary Whittaker
was staging the assault. Anyhow, she probably arrived
there after Mary Whittaker and Vera Findlater had left the
Austin and departed to the hollow on the downs. When Mary
Whittaker had finished her part of the job, they put the handkerchief
and the magazine called <i>The Black Mask</i> into the
Austin and drove off in Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s car. I&rsquo;m having the
movements of the car investigated, naturally. It&rsquo;s a dark blue
Renault fourseater, with Michelin balloon-tyres, and the number
is X04247. We know that it returned to Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s
garage on the Monday night with Mrs. Forrest in it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;But where is Miss Whittaker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In hiding somewhere. We shall get her all right. She can&rsquo;t
get money from her own bank&mdash;they&rsquo;re warned. If Mrs. Forrest
tries to get money for her, she will be followed. So if the worst
comes to the worst, we can starve her out in time with any
luck. But we&rsquo;ve got another clue. There has been a most determined
attempt to throw suspicion on an unfortunate relative
of Miss Whittaker&rsquo;s&mdash;a black Nonconformist parson, with the
remarkable name of Hallelujah Dawson. He has certain pecuniary
claims on Miss Whittaker&mdash;not legal claims, but claims
which any decent and humane person should have respected.
She didn&rsquo;t respect them, and the poor old man might very well
have been expected to nurse a grudge against her. Yesterday
morning he tried to cash a Bearer cheque of hers for &pound;10,000,
with a lame-sounding story to the effect that it had arrived by
the first post, without explanation, in an envelope. So, of
course, he&rsquo;s had to be detained as one of the kidnappers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is very clumsy, surely. He&rsquo;s almost certain to have
an alibi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy the story will be that he hired some gangsters to
do the job for him. He belongs to a Mission in Stepney&mdash;where
that mauve cap came from&mdash;and no doubt there are
plenty of tough lads in his neighbourhood. Of course we shall
make close inquiries and publish details broadcast in all the
papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, I fancy, the idea is that Miss Whittaker will
turn up somewhere in an agitated condition with a story of
assault and holding to ransom made to fit the case. If Cousin
Hallelujah has not produced a satisfactory alibi, we shall learn
that he was on the spot directing the murderers. If he has
definitely shown that he wasn&rsquo;t there, his name will have been
mentioned, or he will have turned up at some time which the
poor dear girl couldn&rsquo;t exactly ascertain, in some dreadful den
to which she was taken in a place which she won&rsquo;t be able to
identify.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a devilish plot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Miss Whittaker is a charming young woman. If
there&rsquo;s anything she&rsquo;d stop at, I don&rsquo;t know what it is. And the
amiable Mrs. Forrest appears to be another of the same kidney.
Of course, doctor, we&rsquo;re taking you into our confidence. You
understand that our catching Mary Whittaker depends on her
believing that we&rsquo;ve swallowed all these false clues of hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a talker,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Gang you call it, and
gang it is, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. And Miss Findlater was hit
on the head and died of it. I only hope my colleague and the
Chief Constable will be equally discreet. I warned them, naturally,
after what you said last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;but what positive evidence
have we, after all, against this woman? A clever defending
counsel would tear the whole thing to rags. The only
thing we can absolutely <i>prove</i> her to have done is the burgling
that house on Hampstead Heath and stealing the coal. The
other deaths were returned natural deaths at the inquest. And
as for Miss Findlater&mdash;even if we show it to be chloroform&mdash;well,
chloroform isn&rsquo;t difficult stuff to get hold of&mdash;it&rsquo;s not
arsenic or cyanide. And even if there were finger-prints on the
spanner&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were not,&rdquo; said Parker, gloomily. &ldquo;This girl knows
what she&rsquo;s about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she want to kill Vera Findlater for, anyway?&rdquo;
asked the doctor, suddenly. &ldquo;According to you, the girl was the
most valuable bit of evidence she had. She was the one witness
who could prove that Miss Whittaker had an alibi for the other
crimes&mdash;if they were crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may have found out too much about the connection
between Miss Whittaker and Mrs. Forrest. My impression is
that she had served her turn and become dangerous. What
we&rsquo;re hoping to surprise now is some communication between
Forrest and Whittaker. Once we&rsquo;ve got that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Dr. Faulkner. He had strolled to the window.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to worry you unduly, but I perceive Sir
Charles Pillington in conference with the Special Correspondent
of the <i>Wire</i>. The <i>Yell</i> came out with the gang story all
over the front page this morning, and a patriotic leader about
the danger of encouraging coloured aliens. I needn&rsquo;t remind
you that the <i>Wire</i> would be ready to corrupt the Archangel
Gabriel in order to kill the <i>Yell&rsquo;s</i> story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hell!&rdquo; said Parker, rushing to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;The <i>Wire</i> man has vanished
into the post office. Of course, you can &rsquo;phone up and try to
stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker did so, and was courteously assured by the editor
of the <i>Wire</i> that the story had not reached him, and that if it
did, he would bear Inspector Parker&rsquo;s instructions in mind.</p>
<p>The editor of the <i>Wire</i> was speaking the exact truth. The
story had been received by the editor of the <i>Evening Banner</i>,
sister paper to the <i>Wire</i>. In times of crisis, it is sometimes
convenient that the left hand should not know what the right
hand does. After all, it was an exclusive story.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p class="tb">Thursday, June 23rd, was the Eve of S. John. The sober green
workaday dress in which the church settles down to her daily
duties after the bridal raptures of Pentecost, had been put away,
and the altar was white and shining once again. Vespers were
over in the Lady Chapel at S. Onesimus&mdash;a faint reek of
incense hung cloudily under the dim beams of the roof. A very
short acolyte with a very long brass extinguisher snuffed out
the candles, adding the faintly unpleasant yet sanctified odour
of hot wax. The small congregation of elderly ladies rose up
lingeringly from their devotions and slipped away in a series
of deep genuflections. Miss Climpson gathered up a quantity
of little manuals, and groped for her gloves. In doing so, she
dropped her office-book. It fell, annoyingly, behind the long
kneeler, scattering as it went a small pentecostal shower of
Easter cards, book-markers, sacred pictures, dried palms and
Ave Marias into the dark corner behind the confessional.</p>
<p>Miss Climpson gave a little exclamation of wrath as she
dived after them&mdash;and immediately repented this improper
outburst of anger in a sacred place. &ldquo;Discipline,&rdquo; she murmured,
retrieving the last lost sheep from under a hassock,
&ldquo;discipline. I must learn self-control.&rdquo; She crammed the papers
back into the office-book, grasped her gloves and handbag,
bowed to the Sanctuary, dropped her bag, picked it up this
time in a kind of glow of martyrdom, bustled down the aisle
and across the church to the south door, where the sacristan
stood, key in hand, waiting to let her out. As she went, she
glanced up at the High Altar, unlit and lonely, with the tall
candles like faint ghosts in the twilight of the apse. It had a
grim and awful look she thought, suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Mr. Stanniforth,&rdquo; she said, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Miss Climpson, good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was glad to come out of the shadowy porch into the
green glow of the June evening. She had felt a menace. Was
it the thought of the stern Baptist, with his call to repentance?
the prayer for grace to speak the truth and boldly rebuke vice?
Miss Climpson decided that she would hurry home and read
the Epistle and Gospel&mdash;curiously tender and comfortable for
the festival of that harsh and uncompromising Saint. &ldquo;And I
can tidy up these cards at the same time,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Mrs. Budge&rsquo;s first-floor front seemed stuffy after the scented
loveliness of the walk home. Miss Climpson flung the window
open and sat down by it to rearrange her sanctified oddments.
The card of the Last Supper went in at the Prayer of Consecration;
the Fra Angelico Annunciation had strayed out of the
office for March 25th and was wandering among the Sundays
after Trinity; the Sacred Heart with its French text belonged
to Corpus Christi; the.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Miss Climpson, &ldquo;I
must have picked this up in church.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>Certainly the little sheet of paper was not in her writing.
Somebody must have dropped it. It was natural to look and
see whether it was anything of importance.</p>
<p>Miss Climpson was one of those people who say: &ldquo;I am
not the kind of person who reads other people&rsquo;s postcards.&rdquo; This
is clear notice to all and sundry that they are, precisely, that
kind of person. They are not untruthful; the delusion is real
to them. It is merely that Providence has provided them with
a warning rattle, like that of the rattlesnake. After that, if you
are so foolish as to leave your correspondence in their way, it
is your own affair.</p>
<p>Miss Climpson perused the paper.</p>
<p>In the manuals for self-examination issued to the Catholic-minded,
there is often included an unwise little paragraph
which speaks volumes for the innocent unworldliness of the
compilers. You are advised, when preparing for confession, to
make a little list of your misdeeds, lest one or two peccadilloes
should slip your mind. It is true that you are cautioned against
writing down the names of other people or showing your list
to your friends, or leaving it about. But accidents may happen&mdash;and
it may be that this recording of sins is contrary to
the mind of the church, who bids you whisper them with
fleeting breath into the ear of a priest and bids him, in the
same moment that he absolves, forget them as though they
had never been spoken.</p>
<p>At any rate, somebody had been recently shriven of the
sins set forth upon the paper&mdash;probably the previous Saturday&mdash;and
the document had fluttered down unnoticed between
the confession-box and the hassock, escaping the eye of
the cleaner. And here it was&mdash;the tale that should have been
told to none but God&mdash;lying open upon Mrs. Budge&rsquo;s round
mahogany table under the eye of a fellow-mortal.</p>
<p>To do Miss Climpson justice, she would probably have
destroyed it instantly unread, if one sentence had not caught
her eye:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lies I told for M. W.&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>At the same moment she realised that this was Vera Findlater&rsquo;s
handwriting, and it &ldquo;came over her like a flash&rdquo;&mdash;as she
explained afterwards, exactly what the implication of the words
was.</p>
<p>For a full half-hour Miss Climpson sat alone, struggling
with her conscience. Her natural inquisitiveness said &ldquo;Read&rdquo;;
her religious training said, &ldquo;You must not read&rdquo;; her sense of
duty to Wimsey, who employed her, said, &ldquo;Find out&rdquo;; her own
sense of decency said, &ldquo;Do no such thing&rdquo;; a dreadful, harsh
voice muttered gratingly, &ldquo;Murder is the question. Are you
going to be the accomplice of Murder?&rdquo; She felt like Lancelot
Gobbo between conscience and the fiend&mdash;but which was the
fiend and which was conscience?</p>
<p>&ldquo;To speak the truth and boldly rebuke vice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murder.</p>
<p>There was a real possibility now.</p>
<p>But <i>was</i> it a possibility? Perhaps she had read into the
sentence more than it would bear.</p>
<p>In that case, was it not&mdash;almost&mdash;a duty to read further
and free her mind from this horrible suspicion?</p>
<p>She would have liked to go to Mr. Tredgold and ask his
advice. Probably he would, tell her to burn the paper promptly
and drive suspicion out of her mind with prayer and fasting.</p>
<p>She got up and began searching for the match-box. It
would be better to get rid of the thing quickly.</p>
<p>What, exactly, was she about to do?&mdash;To destroy the clue
to the discovery of a Murder?</p>
<p>Whenever she thought of the word, it wrote itself upon
her brain in large capitals, heavily underlined. MURDER&mdash;like
a police-bill.</p>
<p>Then she had an idea. Parker was a policeman&mdash;and
probably also he had no particular feelings about the sacred
secrecy of the Confessional. He had a Protestant appearance&mdash;or
possibly he thought nothing of religion one way or the other.
In any case, he would put his professional duty before everything.
Why not send him the paper, without reading it, briefly
explaining how she had come upon it? Then the responsibility
would be his.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>On consideration, however, Miss Climpson&rsquo;s innate honesty
scouted this scheme as jesuitical. Secrecy was violated by
this open publication as much as if she had read the thing&mdash;or
more so. The old Adam, too, raised his head at this point,
suggesting that if anybody was going to see the confession, she
might just as well satisfy her own reasonable curiosity. Besides&mdash;suppose
she was quite mistaken. After all, the &ldquo;lies&rdquo; might
have nothing whatever to do with Mary Whittaker&rsquo;s alibi. In
that case, she would have betrayed another person&rsquo;s secret wantonly,
and to no purpose. If she <i>did</i> decide to show it, she was
bound to read it first&mdash;in justice to all parties concerned.</p>
<p>Perhaps&mdash;if she just glanced at another word or two, she
would see that it had nothing to do with&mdash;MURDER&mdash;and
then she could destroy it and forget it. She knew that if she
destroyed it unread she never would forget it, to the end of her
life. She would always carry with her that grim suspicion. She
would think of Mary Whittaker as&mdash;perhaps&mdash;a Murderess.
When she looked into those hard blue eyes, she would be
wondering what sort of expression they had when the soul
behind them was plotting&mdash;MURDER. Of course, the suspicions
had been there before, planted by Wimsey, but now
they were her own suspicions. They crystallised&mdash;became real
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a quick, shamefaced glance at the paper again.
This time she saw the word &ldquo;London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Climpson gave a kind of little gasp, like a person
stepping under a cold shower-bath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Climpson, &ldquo;if this is a sin I am going
to do it, and may I be forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a red flush creeping over her cheeks as though she
were stripping something naked, she turned her attention to
the paper.</p>
<p>The jottings were brief and ambiguous. Parker might not
have made much of them, but to Miss Climpson, trained in
this kind of devotional shorthand, the story was clear as print.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jealousy&rdquo;&mdash;the word was written large and underlined.
Then there was a reference to a quarrel, to wicked accusations
and angry words and to a pre-occupation coming between the
penitent&rsquo;s soul and God. &ldquo;Idol&rdquo;&mdash;and a long dash.</p>
<p>From these few fossil bones, Miss Climpson had little
difficulty in reconstructing one of those hateful and passionate
&ldquo;scenes&rdquo; of slighted jealousy with which a woman-ridden life
had made her only too familiar. &ldquo;I do everything for you&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t care a bit for me&mdash;you treat me cruelly&mdash;you&rsquo;re
simply sick of me, that&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo; And &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so ridiculous.
Really, I can&rsquo;t stand this. Oh, stop it, Vera! I hate being slobbered
over.&rdquo; Humiliating, degrading, exhausting, beastly scenes.
Girls&rsquo; school, boarding-house, Bloomsbury-flat scenes. Damnable
selfishness wearying of its victim. Silly <i>schw&auml;rmerei</i>
swamping all decent self-respect. Barren quarrels ending in
shame and hatred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beastly, blood-sucking woman,&rdquo; said Miss Climpson, viciously.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad. She&rsquo;s only making use of the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the self-examiner was now troubled with a more difficult
problem. Piecing the hints together, Miss Climpson sorted
it out with practised ease. Lies had been told&mdash;that was wrong,
even though done to help a friend. Bad confessions had been
made, suppressing those lies. This ought to be confessed and
put right. But (the girl asked herself) had she come to this
conclusion out of hatred of the lies or out of spite against the
friend? Difficult, this searching of the heart. And ought she,
not content with confessing the lies to the priest, also to tell
the truth to the world?</p>
<p>Miss Climpson had here no doubt what the priest&rsquo;s ruling
would be. &ldquo;You need not go out of your way to betray your
friend&rsquo;s confidence. Keep silent if you can, but if you speak
you must speak the truth. You must tell your friend that she
is not to expect any more lying from you. She is entitled to
ask for secrecy&mdash;no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far, so good. But there was a further problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought I to connive at her doing what is wrong?&rdquo;&mdash;and
then a sort of explanatory aside&mdash;&ldquo;the man in South Audley
Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a little mysterious.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No!&mdash;on the contrary, it
explained the whole mystery, jealousy, quarrel and all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>In those weeks of April and May, when Mary Whittaker
had been supposed to be all the time in Kent with Vera Findlater,
she had been going up to London. And Vera had promised
to say that Mary was with her the whole time. And the visits
to London had to do with a man in South Audley Street, and
there was something sinful about it. That probably meant a
love-affair. Miss Climpson pursed her lips virtuously, but she
was more surprised than shocked. Mary Whittaker! she would
never have suspected it of her, somehow. But it so explained
the jealousy and the quarrel&mdash;the sense of desertion. But how
had Vera found out? Had Mary Whittaker confided in her?&mdash;No;
that sentence again, under the heading &ldquo;Jealousy&rdquo;&mdash;what
was it&mdash;&ldquo;following M. W to London.&rdquo; She had followed then,
and seen. And then, at some moment, she had burst out with
her knowledge&mdash;reproached her friend. Yet this expedition to
London must have happened before her own conversation with
Vera Findlater, and the girl had then seemed so sure of Mary&rsquo;s
affection. Or had it been that she was trying to persuade herself,
with determined self-deception, that there was &ldquo;nothing in&rdquo;
this business about the man? Probably. And probably some
brutality of Mary&rsquo;s had brought all the miserable suspicions
boiling to the surface, vocal, reproachful and furious. And so
they had gone on to the row and the break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer,&rdquo; thought Miss Climpson, &ldquo;that Vera has never
come and told me about her trouble. But perhaps she is ashamed,
poor child. I haven&rsquo;t seen her for nearly a week. I think I&rsquo;ll
call and see her and perhaps she&rsquo;ll tell me all about it. In which
case&rdquo;&mdash;cried Miss Climpson&rsquo;s conscience, suddenly emerging
with a bright and beaming smile from under the buffets of the
enemy&mdash;&ldquo;in which case I shall know the whole history of it
legitimately and can <i>quite honourably</i> tell Lord Peter about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day&mdash;which was the Friday&mdash;she woke, however,
with an unpleasant ache in the conscience. The paper&mdash;still
tucked into the office-book&mdash;worried her. She went round
early to Vera Findlater&rsquo;s house, only to hear that she was staying
with Miss Whittaker. &ldquo;Then I suppose they&rsquo;ve made it up,&rdquo;
she said. She did not want to see Mary Whittaker, whether her
secret was murder or mere immorality; but she was tormented
by the desire to clear up the matter of the alibi for Lord Peter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>In Wellington Avenue she was told that the two girls had
gone away on the Monday and had not yet returned. She tried
to reassure the maid, but her own heart misgave her. Without
any real reason, she was uneasy. She went round to the church
and said her prayers, but her mind was not on what she was
saying. On an impulse, she caught Mr. Tredgold as he pottered
in and out of the Sacristy, and asked if she might come the
next evening to lay a case of conscience before him. So far,
so good, and she felt that a &ldquo;good walk&rdquo; might help to clear
the cob-webs from her brain.</p>
<p>So she started off, missing Lord Peter by a quarter of an
hour, and took the train to Guildford and then walked and had
lunch in a wayside tea-shop and walked back into Guildford
and so came home, where she learnt that &ldquo;Mr. Parker and ever
so many gentlemen had been asking for her all day, and what
a dreadful thing, miss, here was Miss Whittaker and Miss
Findlater disappeared and the police out looking for them, and
them motor-cars was such dangerous things, miss, wasn&rsquo;t they?
It was to be hoped there wasn&rsquo;t an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And into Miss Climpson&rsquo;s mind there came, like an inspiration,
the words, &ldquo;South Audley Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Climpson did not, of course, know that Wimsey was
at Crow&rsquo;s Beach. She hoped to find him in Town. For she was
seized with a desire, which she could hardly have explained
even to herself, to go and look at South Audley Street. What
she was to do when she got there she did not know, but go
there she must. It was the old reluctance to make open use of
that confession paper. Vera Findlater&rsquo;s story at first hand&mdash;that
was the idea to which she obscurely clung. So she took the
first train to Waterloo, leaving behind her, in case Wimsey or
Parker should call again, a letter so obscure and mysterious
and so lavishly underlined and interlined that it was perhaps
fortunate for their reason that they were never faced with it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>In Piccadilly she saw Bunter, and learned that his lordship
was at Crow&rsquo;s Beach with Mr. Parker, where he, Bunter, was
just off to join him. Miss Climpson promptly charged him with
a message to his employer slightly more involved and mysterious
than her letter, and departed for South Audley Street. It
was only when she was walking up it that she realised how
vague her quest was and how little investigation one can do
by merely walking along a street. Also, it suddenly occurred
to her that if Miss Whittaker was carrying on anything of a
secret nature in South Audley Street, the sight of an acquaintance
patrolling the pavement would put her on her guard.
Much struck by this reflection, Miss Climpson plunged abruptly
into a Chemist&rsquo;s shop and bought a toothbrush, by way of
concealing her movements and gaining time. One can while
away many minutes comparing the shapes, sizes and bristles
of toothbrushes, and sometimes chemists will be nice and gossipy.</p>
<p>Looking round the shop for inspiration, Miss Climpson
observed a tin of nasal snuff labelled with the chemist&rsquo;s own
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take a tin of that, too, please,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What
<i>excellent</i> stuff it is&mdash;quite <i>wonderful</i>. I have used it for <i>years</i>
and am really <i>delighted</i> with it. I recommend it to all my
friends, particularly for <i>hay fever</i>. In fact, there&rsquo;s a friend of
mine who often passes your shop, who told me only <i>yesterday</i>
what a <i>martyr</i> she was to that complaint. &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; I said to
her, &lsquo;you have only to get a tin of this <i>splendid</i> stuff and you
will be <i>quite</i> all right <i>all</i> summer.&rsquo; She was so <i>grateful</i> to me
for telling her about it. Has she been in for it yet?&rdquo; And she
described Mary Whittaker closely.</p>
<p>It will be noticed, by the way, that in the struggle between
Miss Climpson&rsquo;s conscience and what Wilkie Collins calls &ldquo;detective
fever,&rdquo; conscience was getting the worst of it and was
winking at an amount of deliberate untruth which a little time
earlier would have staggered it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>The chemist, however, had seen nothing of Miss Climpson&rsquo;s
friend. Nothing, therefore, was to be done but to retire
from the field and think what was next to be done. Miss Climpson
left, but before leaving she neatly dropped her latchkey
into a large basket full of sponges standing at her elbow. She
felt she might like to have an excuse to visit South Audley
Street again.</p>
<p>Conscience sighed deeply, and her guardian angel dropped
a tear among the sponges.</p>
<p>Retiring into the nearest tea-shop she came to, Miss
Climpson ordered a cup of coffee and started to think out a
plan for honey-combing South Audley Street. She needed an
excuse&mdash;and a disguise. An adventurous spirit was welling up
in her elderly bosom, and her first dozen or so ideas were more
lurid than practical.</p>
<p>At length a really brilliant notion occurred to her. She
was (she did not attempt to hide it from herself) precisely the
type and build of person one associates with the collection of
subscriptions. Moreover, she had a perfectly good and genuine
cause ready to hand. The church which she attended in London
ran a slum mission, which was badly in need of funds,
and she possessed a number of collecting cards, bearing full
authority to receive subscriptions on its behalf. What more
natural than that she should try a little house-to-house visiting
in a wealthy quarter?</p>
<p>The question of disguise, also, was less formidable than
it might appear. Miss Whittaker had only known her well-dressed
and affluent in appearance. Ugly, clumping shoes, a
hat of virtuous ugliness, a shapeless coat and a pair of tinted
glasses would disguise her sufficiently at a distance. At close
quarters, it would not matter if she was recognised, for if once
she got to close quarters with Mary Whittaker, her job was
done and she had found the house she wanted.</p>
<p>Miss Climpson rose from the table, paid her bill and hurried
out to buy the glasses, remembering that it was Saturday.
Having secured a pair which hid her eyes effectively without
looking exaggeratedly mysterious, she made for her rooms in
St. George&rsquo;s Square, to choose suitable clothing for her adventure.
She realised, of course, that she could hardly start
work till Monday&mdash;Saturday afternoon and Sunday are hopeless
from the collector&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>The choice of clothes and accessories occupied her for the
better part of the afternoon. When she was at last satisfied she
went downstairs to ask her landlady for some tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, miss,&rdquo; said the good woman. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it awful,
miss, about this murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What murder?&rdquo; asked Miss Climpson, vaguely.</p>
<p>She took the <i>Evening Views</i> from her landlady&rsquo;s hand,
and read the story of Vera Findlater&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p class="tb">Sunday was the most awful day Miss Climpson had ever
spent. An active woman, she was condemned to inactivity, and
she had time to brood over the tragedy. Not having Wimsey&rsquo;s or
Parker&rsquo;s inside knowledge, she took the kidnapping story at its
face value. In a sense, she found it comforting, for she was able
to acquit Mary Whittaker of any share in this or the previous murders.
She put them down&mdash;except, of course, in the case of Miss
Dawson, and that might never have been a murder after all&mdash;to
the mysterious man in South Audley Street. She formed a nightmare
image of him in her mind&mdash;blood-boltered, sinister, and&mdash;most
horrible of all&mdash;an associate and employer of debauched
and brutal assassins. To Miss Climpson&rsquo;s credit be it said that she
never for one moment faltered in her determination to track the
monster to his lurking-place.</p>
<p>She wrote a long letter to Lord Peter, detailing her plans.
Bunter, she knew, had left 110<span class="small">A</span> Piccadilly, so, after considerable
thought, she addressed it to Lord Peter Wimsey, c/o
Inspector Parker, The Police-Station, Crow&rsquo;s Beach. There
was, of course, no Sunday post from Town. However, it would
go with the midnight collection.</p>
<p>On the Monday morning she set out early, in her old clothes
and her spectacles, for South Audley Street. Never had her natural
inquisitiveness and her hard training in third-rate boarding-houses
stood her in better stead. She had learned to ask questions
without heeding rebuffs&mdash;to be persistent, insensitive and observant.
In every flat she visited she acted her natural self, with
so much sincerity and such limpet-like obstinacy that she seldom
came away without a subscription and almost never without some
information about the flat and its inmates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>By tea-time, she had done one side of the street and nearly
half the other, without result. She was just thinking of going to
get some food, when she caught sight of a woman, about a hundred
yards ahead, walking briskly in the same direction as herself.</p>
<p>Now it is easy to be mistaken in faces, but almost impossible
not to recognise a back. Miss Climpson&rsquo;s heart gave a bound.
&ldquo;Mary Whittaker!&rdquo; she said to herself, and started to follow.</p>
<p>The woman stopped to look into a shop window. Miss
Climpson hesitated to come closer. If Mary Whittaker was at
large, then&mdash;why then the kidnapping had been done with her
own consent. Puzzled, Miss Climpson determined to play a
waiting game. The woman went into the shop. The friendly
chemist&rsquo;s was almost opposite. Miss Climpson decided that this
was the moment to reclaim her latchkey. She went in and asked
for it. It had been put aside for her and the assistant produced
it at once. The woman was still in the shop over the way. Miss
Climpson embarked upon a long string of apologies and circumstantial
details about her carelessness. The woman came
out. Miss Climpson gave her a longish start, brought the conversation
to a close, and fussed out again, replacing the glasses
which she had removed for the chemist&rsquo;s benefit.</p>
<p>The woman walked on without stopping, but she looked into
the shop windows from time to time. A man with a fruiterer&rsquo;s
barrow removed his cap as she passed and scratched his head.
Almost at once, the woman turned quickly and came back. The
fruiterer picked up the handles of his barrow and trundled it away
into a side street. The woman came straight on, and Miss Climpson
was obliged to dive into a doorway and pretend to be tying a
bootlace, to avoid a face to face encounter.</p>
<p>Apparently the woman had only forgotten to buy cigarettes.
She went into a tobacconist&rsquo;s and emerged again in a minute or
two, passing Miss Climpson again. That lady had dropped her
bag and was agitatedly sorting its contents. The woman passed
her without a glance and went on. Miss Climpson, flushed from
stooping, followed again. The woman turned in at the entrance
to a block of flats next door to a florist&rsquo;s. Miss Climpson was hard
on her heels now, for she was afraid of losing her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Mary Whittaker&mdash;if it was Mary Whittaker&mdash;went straight
through the hall to the lift, which was one of the kind worked
by the passenger. She stepped in and shot up. Miss Climpson&mdash;gazing
at the orchids and roses in the florist&rsquo;s window&mdash;watched
the lift out of sight. Then, with her subscription card prominently
in her hand, she too entered the flats.</p>
<p>There was a porter on duty in a little glass case. He at
once spotted Miss Climpson as a stranger and asked politely if
he could do anything for her. Miss Climpson, selecting a name
at random from the list of occupants in the entrance, asked
which was Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s flat. The man replied that it was on
the fourth floor, and stepped forward to bring the lift down for
her. A man, to whom he had been chatting, moved quietly
from the glass case and took up a position in the doorway. As
the lift ascended, Miss Climpson noticed that the fruiterer had
returned. His barrow now stood just outside.</p>
<p>The porter had come up with her, and pointed out the
door of Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s flat. His presence was reassuring. She
wished he would stay within call till she had concluded her
search of the building. However, having asked for Mrs. Forrest,
she must begin there. She pressed the bell.</p>
<p>At first she thought the flat was empty, but after ringing
a second time she heard footsteps. The door opened, and a
heavily over-dressed and peroxided lady made her appearance,
whom Lord Peter would at once&mdash;and embarrassingly&mdash;have
recognised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; said Miss Climpson, wedging herself briskly
in at the doorway with the skill of the practised canvasser, &ldquo;to
try if I can enlist your help for our Mission Settlement. May
I come in? I am sure you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Forrest, shortly, and in a hurried,
breathless tone, as if there was somebody behind her who she
was anxious should not overhear her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested in
Missions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to shut the door. But Miss Climpson had seen
and heard enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; she cried, staring, &ldquo;why, it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; Mrs. Forrest caught her by the arm almost
roughly and pulled her over the threshold, slamming the door
behind them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;How extraordinary!&rdquo; said Miss Climpson, &ldquo;I hardly recognised
you, Miss Whittaker, with your hair like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; said Mary Whittaker. &ldquo;You&mdash;of all people!&rdquo; They
sat facing one another in the sitting-room with its tawdry pink
silk cushions. &ldquo;I knew you were a meddler. How did you get
here? Is there anyone with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;yes&mdash;I just happened,&rdquo; began Miss Climpson
vaguely. One thought was uppermost in her mind. &ldquo;How did
you get free? What happened? Who killed Vera?&rdquo; She knew
she was asking her questions crudely and stupidly. &ldquo;Why are
you disguised like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sent you?&rdquo; reiterated Mary Whittaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the man with you?&rdquo; pursued Miss Climpson. &ldquo;Is
he here? Did he do the murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man Vera saw leaving your flat. Did he&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it. Vera told you. The liar. I thought I had been
quick enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, something which had been troubling Miss
Climpson for weeks crystallised and became plain to her. The
expression in Mary Whittaker&rsquo;s eyes. A long time ago, Miss
Climpson had assisted a relative to run a boarding-house, and
there had been a young man who paid his bill by cheque. She
had had to make a certain amount of unpleasantness about the
bill, and he had written the cheque unwillingly, sitting, with
her eye upon him, at the little plush-covered table in the
drawing-room. Then he had gone away&mdash;slinking out with his
bag when no one was about. And the cheque had come back,
like the bad penny that it was. A forgery. Miss Climpson had
had to give evidence. She remembered now the odd, defiant
look with which the young man had taken up his pen for his
first plunge into crime. And to-day she was seeing it again&mdash;an
unattractive mingling of recklessness and calculation. It was
with the look which had once warned Wimsey and should have
warned her. She breathed more quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was the man?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;The man?&rdquo; Mary Whittaker laughed suddenly. &ldquo;A man
called Templeton&mdash;no friend of mine. It&rsquo;s really funny that
you should think he was a friend of mine. I would have killed
him if I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is he? What are you doing? Don&rsquo;t you know
that everybody is looking for you? Why don&rsquo;t you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Whittaker flung her ten o&rsquo;clock edition of the <i>Evening
Banner</i>, which was lying on the sofa. Miss Climpson read
the glaring headlines.</p>
<p class="center">AMAZING NEW DEVELOPMENTS
<br>IN CROW&rsquo;S BEACH CRIME.
<br>&mdash;&mdash;
<br>WOUNDS ON BODY INFLICTED AFTER DEATH.
<br>&mdash;&mdash;
<br>FAKED FOOTPRINTS.
<br>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Miss Climpson gasped with amazement, and bent over
the smaller type. &ldquo;How extraordinary!&rdquo; she said, looking up
quickly.</p>
<p>Not quite quickly enough. The heavy brass lamp missed
her head indeed, but fell numbingly on her shoulder. She
sprang to her feet with a loud shriek, just as Mary Whittaker&rsquo;s
strong white hands closed upon her throat.</p>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIII</span>

<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p class="tb">Lord Peter missed both Miss Climpson&rsquo;s communications. Absorbed
in the police inquiry, he never thought to go back to Leahampton.
Bunter had duly arrived with &ldquo;Mrs. Merdle&rdquo; on the
Saturday evening. Immense police activity was displayed in the
neighbourhood of the downs, and at Southampton and Portsmouth,
in order to foster the idea that the authorities supposed
the &ldquo;gang&rdquo; to be lurking in those districts. Nothing, as a matter
of fact, was farther from Parker&rsquo;s thoughts. &ldquo;Let her think she is
safe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and she&rsquo;ll come back. It&rsquo;s the cat-and-mouse act
for us, old man.&rdquo; Wimsey fretted. He wanted the analysis of the
body to be complete and loathed the thought of the long days he
had to wait. And he had small hope of the result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well sitting round with your large disguised
policemen outside Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s flat,&rdquo; he said irritably, over
the bacon and eggs on Monday morning, &ldquo;but you do realise,
don&rsquo;t you, that we&rsquo;ve still got no proof of murder. Not in one
single case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; replied Parker, placidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, doesn&rsquo;t it make your blood boil?&rdquo; said Wimsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;This kind of thing happens too
often. If my blood boiled every time there was a delay in getting
evidence, I should be in a perpetual fever. Why worry? It may
be that perfect crime you&rsquo;re so fond of talking about&mdash;the one
that leaves no trace. You ought to be charmed with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I daresay. O Turpitude, where are the charms that
sages have seen in thy face? Time&rsquo;s called at the Criminals&rsquo;
Arms, and there isn&rsquo;t a drink in the place. Wimsey&rsquo;s Standard
Poets, with emendations by Thingummy. As a matter of fact,
I&rsquo;m not at all sure that Miss Dawson&rsquo;s death <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> the perfect
crime&mdash;if only the Whittaker girl had stopped at that and not
tried to cover it up. If you notice, the deaths are becoming
more and more violent, elaborate and unlikely in appearance.
Telephone again. If the Post Office accounts don&rsquo;t show a
handsome profit on telephones this year it won&rsquo;t be your fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the cap and shoes,&rdquo; said Parker, mildly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
traced them. They were ordered from an outfitter&rsquo;s in Stepney,
to be sent to the Rev. H. Dawson, Peveril Hotel, Bloomsbury,
to await arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Peveril again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I recognise the hand of Mr. Trigg&rsquo;s mysterious
charmer. The Rev. Hallelujah Dawson&rsquo;s card, with message
&lsquo;Please give parcel to bearer,&rsquo; was presented by a District Messenger
next day, with a verbal explanation that the gentleman
found he could not get up to Town after all. The messenger,
obeying instructions received by telephone, took the parcel to
a lady in a nurse&rsquo;s dress on the platform at Charing Cross.
Asked to describe the lady, he said she was tall and wore blue
glasses and the usual cloak and bonnet. So that&rsquo;s that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How were the goods paid for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Postal order, purchased at the West Central office at the
busiest moment of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when did all this happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most interesting part of the business. Last month,
shortly before Miss Whittaker and Miss Findlater returned from
Kent. This plot was well thought out beforehand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Well, that&rsquo;s something more for you to pin on to
Mrs. Forrest. It looks like proof of conspiracy, but whether it&rsquo;s
proof of murder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>meant</i> to look like a conspiracy of Cousin Hallelujah&rsquo;s,
I suppose. Oh, well, we shall have to trace the letters and the
typewriter that wrote them and interrogate all these people, I suppose.
God! what a grind! Hullo! Come in! Oh, it&rsquo;s you, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse my interrupting your breakfast,&rdquo; said Dr. Faulkner,
&ldquo;but early this morning, while lying awake, I was visited
with a bright idea. So I had to come and work it off on you
while it was fresh. About the blow on the head and the marks
on the arms, you know. Do you suppose they served a double
purpose? Besides making it look like the work of a gang, could
they be hiding some other, smaller mark? Poison, for instance,
could be injected, and the mark covered up by scratches and
cuts inflicted after death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;I wish I could think it. It&rsquo;s a very
sound idea and may be the right one. Our trouble is, that in
the two previous deaths which we have been investigating, and
which we are inclined to think form a part of the same series
as this one, there have been no signs or traces of poison discoverable
in the bodies at all by any examination or analysis
that skill can devise. In fact, not only no proof of poison, but
no proof of anything but natural death.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>And he related the cases in fuller detail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;And you think this may turn out
the same way. Still, in this case the death can&rsquo;t very well have
been natural&mdash;or why these elaborate efforts to cover it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Parker; &ldquo;the proof being that&mdash;as we now
know&mdash;the plot was laid nearly two months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the method!&rdquo; cried Wimsey, &ldquo;the method! Hang it
all&mdash;here are all we people with our brilliant brains and our
professional reputations&mdash;and this half-trained girl out of a
hospital can beat the lot of us. How was it done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably something so simple and obvious that it&rsquo;s
never occurred to us,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;The sort of principle you
learn when you&rsquo;re in the fourth form and never apply to anything.
Rudimentary. Like that motor-cycling imbecile we met
up at Crofton, who sat in the rain and prayed for help because
he&rsquo;d never heard of an air-lock in his feed. Now I daresay that
boy had learnt&mdash;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried Wimsey. He smashed his hand down
among the breakfast things, upsetting his cup. &ldquo;My God! But
that&rsquo;s it! You&rsquo;ve got it&mdash;you&rsquo;ve done it&mdash;Obvious? God Almighty&mdash;it
doesn&rsquo;t need a doctor. A garage hand could have
told you. People die of it every day. Of course, it was an air-lock
in the feed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear up, doctor,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s always like this when
he gets an idea. It wears off in time. D&rsquo;you mind explaining
yourself, old thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wimsey&rsquo;s pallid face was flushed. He turned on the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the body&rsquo;s a pumping engine, isn&rsquo;t
it? The jolly old heart pumps the blood round the arteries and
back through the veins and so on, doesn&rsquo;t it? That&rsquo;s what keeps
things working, what? Round and home again in two minutes&mdash;that
sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little valve to let the blood out; &rsquo;nother little valve to let
it in&mdash;just like an internal combustion engine, which it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;And s&rsquo;posin&rsquo; that stops?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Now, look here. S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; you take a good big hypodermic,
empty, and dig it into one of the big arteries and push
the handle&mdash;what would happen? What would happen, doctor?
You&rsquo;d be pumpin&rsquo; a big air-bubble into your engine feed, wouldn&rsquo;t
you? What would become of your circulation, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would stop it,&rdquo; said the doctor, without hesitation.
&ldquo;That is why nurses have to be particular to fill the syringe
properly, especially when doing an intra-venous injection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>knew</i> it was the kind of thing you learnt in the fourth
form. Well, go on. Your circulation would stop&mdash;it would be
like an embolism in its effect, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only if it was in a main artery, of course. In a small vein
the blood would find a way round. That is why&rdquo; (this seemed
to be the doctor&rsquo;s favourite opening) &ldquo;that is why it is so important
that embolisms&mdash;blood-clots&mdash;should be dispersed as
soon as possible and not left to wander about the system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;but the air-bubble, doctor&mdash;in a main artery&mdash;say
the femoral or the big vein in the bend of the elbow&mdash;that
would stop the circulation, wouldn&rsquo;t it? How soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, at once. The heart would stop beating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what symptoms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None to speak of. Just a gasp or two. The lungs would
make a desperate effort to keep things going. Then you&rsquo;d just
stop. Like heart failure. It would <i>be</i> heart failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How well I know it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That sneeze in the carburettor&mdash;a
gasping, as you say. And what would be the post-mortem
symptoms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None. Just the appearances of heart failure. And, of course,
the little mark of the needle, if you happened to be looking for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure of all this, doctor?&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s simple, isn&rsquo;t it? A plain problem in mechanics.
Of course that would happen. It must happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it be proved?&rdquo; insisted Parker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must try,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ingenious, and it explains
a lot of things. Doctor, will you go down to the mortuary again
and see if you can find any puncture mark on the body. I really
think you&rsquo;ve got the explanation of the whole thing, Peter. Oh,
dear! Who&rsquo;s on the &rsquo;phone now?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What?&mdash;<i>what?</i>&mdash;oh, hell!&mdash;Well,
that&rsquo;s torn it. She&rsquo;ll never come back now. Warn all the
ports&mdash;send out an all-stations call&mdash;watch the railways and
go through Bloomsbury with a toothcomb&mdash;that&rsquo;s the part she
knows best. I&rsquo;m coming straight up to Town now&mdash;yes, immediately.
Right you are.&rdquo; He hung up the receiver with a few
brief, choice expressions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That adjectival imbecile, Pillington, has let out all he
knows. The whole story is in the early editions of the <i>Banner</i>.
We&rsquo;re doing no good here. Mary Whittaker will know the
game&rsquo;s up, and she&rsquo;ll be out of the country in two twos, if she
isn&rsquo;t already. Coming back to Town, Wimsey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally. Take you up in the car. Lose no time. Ring
the bell for Bunter, would you? Oh, Bunter, we&rsquo;re going up
to Town. How soon can we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once, my lord. I have been holding your lordship&rsquo;s
and Mr. Parker&rsquo;s things ready packed from hour to hour, in
case a hurried adjournment should be necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is a letter for you, Mr. Parker, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thanks. Ah, yes. The finger-prints off the cheque. H&rsquo;m.
Two sets only&mdash;besides those of the cashier, of course&mdash;Cousin
Hallelujah&rsquo;s and a female set, presumably those of Mary Whittaker.
Yes, obviously&mdash;here are the four fingers of the left hand,
just as one would place them to hold the cheque flat while signing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, sir&mdash;but might I look at that photograph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Take a copy for yourself. I know it interests
you as a photographer. Well, cheerio, doctor. See you in Town
some time. Come on, Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Peter came on. And that, as Dr. Faulkner would say,
was why Miss Climpson&rsquo;s second letter was brought up from
the police-station too late to catch him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p class="tb">They reached Town at twelve&mdash;owing to Wimsey&rsquo;s brisk
work at the wheel&mdash;and went straight to Scotland Yard, dropping
Bunter, at his own request, as he was anxious to return
to the flat. They found the Chief Commissioner in rather a
brusque mood&mdash;angry with the <i>Banner</i> and annoyed with Parker
for having failed to muzzle Pillington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows where she will be found next. She&rsquo;s probably
got a disguise and a get-away all ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably gone already,&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;She could easily
have left England on the Monday or Tuesday and nobody a
penny the wiser. If the coast had seemed clear, she&rsquo;d have come
back and taken possession of her goods again. Now she&rsquo;ll stay
abroad. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much afraid you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; agreed Parker, gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, what is Mrs. Forrest doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behaving quite normally. She&rsquo;s been carefully shadowed,
of course, but not interfered with in any way. We&rsquo;ve got three
men out there now&mdash;one as a coster&mdash;one as a dear friend of
the hall-porter&rsquo;s who drops in every so often with racing tips,
and an odd-job man doing a spot of work in the back-yard.
They report that she has been in and out, shopping and so on,
but mostly having her meals at home. No one has called. The
men deputed to shadow her away from the flat have watched
carefully to see if she speaks to anyone or slips money to anyone.
We&rsquo;re pretty sure the two haven&rsquo;t met yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir.&rdquo; An officer put his head in at the door.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Lord Peter Wimsey&rsquo;s man, sir, with an urgent message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bunter entered, trimly correct in bearing, but with a glitter
in his eye. He laid down two photographs on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, my lord and gentlemen, but would you be
so good as to cast your eyes on these two photographs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finger-prints?&rdquo; said the chief, interrogatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them is our own official photograph of the prints
on the &pound;10,000 cheque,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;The other&mdash;where did
you get this, Bunter? It looks like the same set of prints, but
it&rsquo;s not one of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;They appeared similar, sir, to my uninstructed eye. I
thought it better to place the matter before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send Dewsby here,&rdquo; said the Chief Commissioner.</p>
<p>Dewsby was the head of the fingerprint department, and
he had no hesitation at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are undoubtedly the same prints,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>A light was slowly breaking in on Wimsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bunter&mdash;did these come off that wine-glass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are Mrs. Forrest&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I understood you to say, my lord, and I have filed
them under that name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if the signature on the cheque is genuine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t far to look for our bird,&rdquo; said Parker, brutally.
&ldquo;A double identity; damn the woman, she&rsquo;s made us waste a
lot of time. Well, I think we shall get her now, on the Findlater
murder at least, and possibly on the Gotobed business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I understood there was an alibi for that,&rdquo; said the Chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was,&rdquo; said Parker, grimly, &ldquo;but the witness was the
girl that&rsquo;s just been murdered. Looks as though she had made
up her mind to split and was got rid of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as though several people had had a near squeak of
it,&rdquo; said Wimsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Including you. That yellow hair was a wig, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. It never looked natural, you know. When I was
there that night she had on one of those close turban affairs&mdash;she
might have been bald for all one could see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice the scar on the fingers of the right hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not&mdash;for the very good reason that her fingers were
stiff with rings to the knuckles. There was pretty good sense
behind her ugly bad taste. I suppose I was to be drugged&mdash;or,
failing that, caressed into slumber and then&mdash;shall we say, put
out of circulation! Highly distressin&rsquo; incident. Amorous clubman
dies in a flat. Relations very anxious to hush matter up.
I was selected, I suppose, because I was seen with Evelyn
Cropper at Liverpool. Bertha Gotobed got the same sort of
dose, too, I take it. Met by old employer, accidentally, on
leaving work&mdash;&pound;5 note and nice little dinner&mdash;lashings of
champagne&mdash;poor kid as drunk as a blind fiddler&mdash;bundled
into the car&mdash;finished off there and trundled out to Epping in
company with a ham sandwich and a bottle of Bass. Easy, ain&rsquo;t
it&mdash;when you know how?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;That being so,&rdquo; said the Chief Commissioner, &ldquo;the sooner
we get hold of her the better. You&rsquo;d better go at once, Inspector;
take a warrant for Whittaker or Forrest&mdash;and any help you
may require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come?&rdquo; asked Wimsey, when they were outside
the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? You may be useful. With the men we&rsquo;ve got
there already we shan&rsquo;t need any extra help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car whizzed swiftly through Pall Mall, up St. James&rsquo;s
Street and along Piccadilly. Half-way up South Audley Street
they passed the fruit-seller, with whom Parker exchanged an
almost imperceptible signal. A few doors below the entrance
to the flats they got out and were almost immediately joined
by the hall-porter&rsquo;s sporting friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going out to call you up,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, the Whittaker woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Went up about two minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Forrest there too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She came in just before the other woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;Another good theory gone west.
Are you sure it&rsquo;s Whittaker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s made up with old-fashioned clothes and greyish
hair and so on. But she&rsquo;s the right height and general
appearance. And she&rsquo;s running the old blue spectacle stunt
again. I think it&rsquo;s the right one&mdash;though of course I didn&rsquo;t get
close to her, remembering your instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have a look, anyhow. Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coster had joined them now, and they all entered
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the old girl go up to Forrest&rsquo;s flat all right?&rdquo; asked
the third detective of the porter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Went straight to the door and started something
about a subscription. Then Mrs. Forrest pulled her in
quick and slammed the door. Nobody&rsquo;s come down since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. We&rsquo;ll take ourselves up&mdash;and mind you don&rsquo;t let
anybody give us the slip by the staircase. Now then, Wimsey,
she knows you as Templeton, but she may still not know for
certain that you&rsquo;re working with us. Ring the bell, and when
the door&rsquo;s opened, stick your foot inside. We&rsquo;ll stand just round
the corner here and be ready to rush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man&oelig;uvre was executed. They heard the bell trill
loudly.</p>
<p>Nobody came to answer it, however. Wimsey rang again,
and then bent his ear to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles,&rdquo; he cried suddenly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something going on
here.&rdquo; His face was white. &ldquo;Be quick! I couldn&rsquo;t stand <i>another</i>&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker hastened up and listened. Then he caught Peter&rsquo;s
stick and hammered on the door, so that the hollow liftshaft
echoed with the clamour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on there&mdash;open the door&mdash;this is the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all the time, a horrid, stealthy thumping and gurgling
sounded inside&mdash;dragging of something heavy and a scuffling
noise. Then a loud crash, as though a piece of furniture had
been flung to the floor&mdash;and then a loud hoarse scream, cut
brutally off in the middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break in the door,&rdquo; said Wimsey, the sweat pouring down
his face.</p>
<p>Parker signalled to the heavier of the two policemen. He
came along, shoulder first, lunging. The door shook and cracked.
They stamped and panted in the narrow space.</p>
<p>The door gave way, and they tumbled into the hall. Everything
was ominously quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, quick!&rdquo; sobbed Peter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>A door on the right stood open. A glance assured them that
there was nothing there. They sprang to the sitting-room door
and pushed it. It opened about a foot. Something bulky impeded
its progress. They shoved violently and the obstacle gave. Wimsey
leapt over it&mdash;it was a tall cabinet, fallen, with broken china
strewing the floor. The room bore signs of a violent struggle&mdash;tables
flung down, a broken chair, a smashed lamp. He dashed
for the bedroom, with Parker hard at his heels.</p>
<p>The body of a woman lay limply on the bed. Her long,
grizzled hair hung in a dark rope over the pillow and blood
was on her head and throat. But the blood was running freely,
and Wimsey could have shouted for joy at the sight. Dead
men do not bleed.</p>
<p>Parker gave only one glance at the injured woman. He
made promptly for the dressing-room beyond. A shot sang past
his head&mdash;there was a snarl and a shriek&mdash;and the episode
was over. The constable stood shaking his bitten hand, while
Parker put the come-along-o&rsquo;-me grip on the quarry. He recognised
her readily, though the peroxide wig had fallen awry
and the blue eyes were bleared with terror and fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Parker, quietly, &ldquo;the game&rsquo;s up. It&rsquo;s not a
bit of use. Come, be reasonable. You don&rsquo;t want us to put the
bracelets on, do you? Mary Whittaker, alias Forrest, I arrest you
on the charge&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated for a moment and she saw it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what charge? What have you got against me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of attempting to murder this lady, for a start,&rdquo; said Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old fool!&rdquo; she said, contemptuously, &ldquo;she forced her
way in here and attacked me. Is that all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very probably not,&rdquo; said Parker. &ldquo;I warn you that anything
you say may be taken down and used in evidence at your trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the third officer had already produced a notebook
and was imperturbably writing down: &ldquo;When told the charge,
the prisoner said &lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo;&rdquo; The remark evidently struck him
as an injudicious one, for he licked his pencil with an air of
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the lady all right&mdash;who is it?&rdquo; asked Parker, coming
back to a survey of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Miss Climpson&mdash;God knows how she got here. I think
she&rsquo;s all right, but she&rsquo;s had a rough time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was anxiously sponging her head as he spoke, and at
that moment her eyes opened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; said Miss Climpson, confusedly. &ldquo;The syringe&mdash;you
shan&rsquo;t&mdash;oh!&rdquo; She struggled feebly, and then recognised
Wimsey&rsquo;s anxious face. &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;Lord Peter.
Such an upset. Did you get my letter? Is it all right?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh,
dear! What a state I&rsquo;m in. I&mdash;that woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t worry, Miss Climpson,&rdquo; said Wimsey, much
relieved, &ldquo;everything&rsquo;s quite all right and you mustn&rsquo;t talk. You
must tell us about it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that about a syringe?&rdquo; said Parker, intent on
his case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d got a syringe in her hand,&rdquo; panted Miss Climpson,
trying to sit up, and fumbling with her hands over the bed. &ldquo;I
fainted, I think&mdash;such a struggle&mdash;and something hit me on
the head. And I saw her coming at me with the thing. And I
knocked it out of her hand and I can&rsquo;t remember what happened
afterwards. But I have <i>remarkable</i> vitality,&rdquo; said Miss Climpson,
cheerfully. &ldquo;My dear father always used to say &lsquo;Climpsons take
a lot of killing&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parker was groping on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; said he. In his hand was a hypodermic syringe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s mental, that&rsquo;s what she is,&rdquo; said the prisoner. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
only the hypodermic I use for my injections when I get neuralgia.
There&rsquo;s nothing in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite correct,&rdquo; said Parker, with a significant nod
at Wimsey. &ldquo;There is&mdash;nothing in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">On the Tuesday night, when the prisoner had been committed
for trial on the charges of murdering Bertha Gotobed
and Vera Findlater, and attempting to murder Alexandra
Climpson, Wimsey dined with Parker. The former was depressed
and nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole thing&rsquo;s been beastly,&rdquo; he grumbled. They had
sat up discussing the case into the small hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;interesting. I owe you seven
and six, by the way. We ought to have seen through that Forrest
business earlier, but there seemed no real reason to suspect the
Findlater girl&rsquo;s word as to the alibi. These mistaken loyalties
make a lot of trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think the thing that put us off was that it all started so
early. There seemed no reason for it, but looking back on Trigg&rsquo;s
story it&rsquo;s as plain as a pike-staff. She took a big risk with that
empty house, and she couldn&rsquo;t always expect to find empty
houses handy to do away with people in. The idea was, I
suppose, to build up a double identity, so that, if Mary Whittaker
was ever suspected of anything, she could quietly disappear
and become the frail but otherwise innocent Mrs. Forrest.
The real slip-up was forgetting to take back that &pound;5 note from
Bertha Gotobed. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that, we might never
have known anything about Mrs. Forrest. It must have rattled
her horribly when we turned up there. After that, she was
known to the police in both her characters. The Findlater
business was a desperate attempt to cover up her tracks&mdash;and
it was bound to fail, because it was so complicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But the Dawson murder was beautiful in its ease and
simplicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she had stuck to that and left well alone, we could
never have proved anything. We can&rsquo;t prove it now, which is
why I left it off the charge-sheet. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever met a
more greedy and heartless murderer. She probably really thought
that anyone who inconvenienced her had no right to exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greedy and malicious. Fancy tryin&rsquo; to shove the blame
on poor old Hallelujah. I suppose he&rsquo;d committed the unforgivable
sin of askin&rsquo; her for money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll get it, that&rsquo;s one good thing. The pit digged for
Cousin Hallelujah has turned into a gold-mine. That &pound;10,000
cheque has been honoured. I saw to that first thing, before Whittaker
could remember to try and stop it. Probably she couldn&rsquo;t
have stopped it anyway, as it was duly presented last Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the money legally hers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is. We know it was gained by a crime, but
we haven&rsquo;t charged her with the crime, so that legally no such
crime was committed. I&rsquo;ve not said anything to Cousin Hallelujah,
of course, or he mightn&rsquo;t like to take it. He thinks it
was sent him in a burst of contrition, poor old dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Cousin Hallelujah and all the little Hallelujahs will
be rich. That&rsquo;s splendid. How about the rest of the money?
Will the Crown get it after all?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. Unless she wills it to someone, it will go to the
Whittaker next-of-kin&mdash;a first cousin, I believe, called Allcock.
A very decent fellow, living in Birmingham. That is,&rdquo; he added,
assailed by sudden doubt, &ldquo;if first cousins <i>do</i> inherit under this
confounded Act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think first cousins are safe,&rdquo; said Wimsey, &ldquo;though
nothing seems safe nowadays. Still, dash it all, some relations
must still be allowed a look-in, or what becomes of the sanctity
of family life? If so, that&rsquo;s the most cheering thing about the
beastly business. Do you know, when I rang up that man Carr
and told him all about it, he wasn&rsquo;t a bit interested or grateful.
Said he&rsquo;d always suspected something like that, and he hoped
we weren&rsquo;t going to rake it all up again, because he&rsquo;d come
into that money he told us about and was setting up for himself
in Harley Street, so he didn&rsquo;t want any more scandals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did like that man. I&rsquo;m sorry for Nurse Philliter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be. I put my foot in it again over that. Carr&rsquo;s
too grand to marry a nurse now&mdash;at least, I fancy that&rsquo;s what
it is. Anyway, the engagement&rsquo;s off. And I was so pleased at
the idea of playing Providence to two deserving young people,&rdquo;
added Wimsey, pathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear! Well, the girl&rsquo;s well out of it. Hullo! there&rsquo;s
the &rsquo;phone. Who on earth&mdash;? Some damned thing at the Yard,
I suppose. At three ack emma! Who&rsquo;d be a policeman?&mdash;Yes?&mdash;Oh!&mdash;right,
I&rsquo;ll come round. The case has gone west, Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suicide. Strangled herself with a sheet. I&rsquo;d better go round,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;An evil woman, if ever there was one,&rdquo; said Parker, softly,
as they looked at the rigid body, with its swollen face and the
deeper, red ring about the throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>Wimsey said nothing. He felt cold and sick. While Parker
and the Governor of the prison made the necessary arrangements
and discussed the case, he sat hunched unhappily upon
his chair. Their voices went on and on interminably. Six o&rsquo;clock
had struck some time before they rose to go. It reminded him
of the eight strokes of the clock which announce the running-up
of the black and hideous flag.</p>
<p>As the gate clanged open to let them out, they stepped
into a wan and awful darkness. The June day had risen long
ago, but only a pale and yellowish gleam lit the half-deserted
streets. And it was bitterly cold and raining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with the day?&rdquo; said Wimsey. &ldquo;Is the
world coming to an end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Parker, &ldquo;it is the eclipse.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
